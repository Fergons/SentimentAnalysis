Please tell me how I can accomplish achievements: 1) Veteran of map Aztec, 2) Veteran of map Dust , 3) Veteran of map Shorttrain, 4) This Glass World, 5) Sniper, 6) Tourist when you removed these 3 maps, thereby making these achievements unworkable. I hope to hear an adequate answer from you, since I really do not understand what the problem is: you have deleted maps, delete achievements, do not want to delete achievements, add maps back. + The game is actively supported by developers, updates are coming out. I encounter such a problem for the first time and for my understanding it is nonsense when game developers remove game content so plus tied to achievements. I perform all games on 100% ONLY HONESTLY and how can I perform these achievements when they are broken?\n\nAnswer from Steam support:\n\nWe are currently aware that certain achievements are no longer able to be obtained due to the maps being removed from the game. Unfortunately, we cannot provide a workaround for obtaining these achievements but I have forwarded your concerns on this matter onto the CS:GO team so they're aware. \n\nPlease let us know if you have any other questions or issues that we may assist you with.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nThe developer has done nothing since 2017 when they have broken these 6 achievement. Maybe it is new fashion, break something that is working good. I want you to know only one thing if you ignore the quality of your project remember that this is the way to nowhere. I hope that there is at least 1 person in your development team who understands and will correct this problem.\n\nAbout the game:\n\nThe very good game. Didn't meet any bugs. The game engine gives us the very good picture. Physic in the game done on highest level.\n\n\u0412\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441 \u043a Steam support:\n\n\u0417\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0439\u0442\u0435.

AWP seems very OP...\n\nHello folks, just got the game today from the steam sale. Not completely new to CS, I've owned CSS for a few years now but only because it was on sale bundled with gmod which is what I was really after, though still a fun game that I'd play a few times a month.\n\nOnce thing I've noticed about almost every CSS server I've played on is every sniper but the Scout is banned, for good reason I thought since when I went into servers where they weren't banned no one was using anything but these weapons (mostly the AWP). In a game about making twitch precision headshots, the AWP seems to break it since you don't need to be very precise with it at all.\n\nMy experience with the AWP in CSS is actually why I've put off buying CS GO for so long. I knew that you get into most games through matchmaking meaning you have to deal with AWPS, and I feared most games would be reduced to everyone using AWPS vs everyone using AWPS, with people not using AWPS gettings shit on unless they're miles better than the enemy team. I ended up buying the game anyway today though since it's cheap and very popular.\n\nTurns out my fears were completely justified. The AWP completely breaks the game. All skill goes out the window once you can afford an AWP, just take a seat and anyone who approaches you instantly dies. Honestly I'm really disappointing and I'm already starting to regret this purchase, since I have a lot more fun in CSS where there are mostly no AWPS.\n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way about this weapon? I feel like the game would be so much better off without it. This one weapon is so game breaking that most CSS servers ban it, and this single weapon alone being legal has discouraged me from buying this entire game. I'm sure at the top 5% of play AWPS are balanced and natural part of the game... and CS elitists are going to have a field day with my \"noobish\" complaints, but honestly I don't give a shit :\\ because 95% of players aren't the top 5%.", "marf.", "Very good game, has good Mechanics, easy to get use to, affordable when u want, mm is easy and wm is even more easy , i rate this game a 9/10 u should buy it, it dosnt hurt to try another game other than fortnite :)\n\n- - -[Audience] - - -\n\u2610 Your Mom probably would enjoy this\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Everyone\n\u2611 Everyone except kids\n\u2611 Casual players\n\u2611 Pro players\n\u2611 People who plan to take one game and make it their life\n\n- - - [graphics] - - -\n\n\u2610 I want to poor bleach in my eyes\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\u2610 Bad, but playable.\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\n---[price]---\n\u2611 Free\n\u2610 Buy now\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2610 Wait for sale\n\u2610 Maybe if you have some spare money left\n\u2610 Do not buy it\n\u2610 Do not throw money into a trash can\n\n- - - [specs] - - -\n\n\u2611 Minimum\n\u2610 Medium\n\u2610 High end\n\u2610 NASA computer\n\n- - - [skill] - - -\n\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Average (Depends on the difficulty set)\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Only the best of the best can complete this game\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2611 Nothing\n\u2611 Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 A bit grindy...sometimes\n\u2610 Practically a full time job\n\n- - - [gameplay] - - -\n\n\u2611 Only gameplay, doesn't include a story.\n\u2610 There is a story, but most of the game is focused on gameplay.\n\u2610 Better than nothing I suppose...\n\u2610 Average.\n\u2610 Decent.\n\u2610 Amazing!\n\u2610 It\u2018ll replace your life\n\n- - - [bugs] - - -\n\n\u2610 Game itself is one big BUG\n\u2610 Lot of bugs (Can get annoying)\n\u2611 Few Bugs\n\u2610 You can use them for speedrun\n\u2610 Nothing (I've seen)\n\n---[time]---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of tea\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Not too short\n\u2611 Depends on you\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 Very Long\n\u2611 Endless\n\n- - - [length] - - -\n\u2610 One long, tedious grind\n\u2610 Better than mobile\n\u2610 Fun at first, but gets old quick\n\u2610 Consistently fun\n\u2611 Can't stop playing, even though I should be finished.", "good game", "apart fomr the constant russians telling me to f*** my mum its a great game", "i am black", "best game ngl so much better than valorant", "Give me knife or i will kill you all :)", "Great matchmaking", "good game", "It's Good.\n", "got better", "veyr tresh :(", "BEST OF THE BEST", "+ rep good game", "Nice Game", " so hhalalal mode so mcuh fun!", "Amazing game, as usual!", "Pls no", "liked it", "There are a lot of cheaters but still ok", "dancers", "nice game \ud83d\udc9c", "Very good BUM BUM nice skin BAM BAM yes", "Best game ever!!!", "nice game", "I got shot", "This game took all my money...", "Awesome if cheaters going off 4 just a hour", "FUN game try it out just try it out its a super fun game", "Love it, been playing for a looooong time", "pretty cool game", "cool game\n", "Game is very nice its my second time playing it <3", "this game good", "str8 banger bro", "every time i play comp, i get kicked while iam doing good, last game i played it was 15-7 til us and they kicked me, nice game", "bad game", "Good Game", "good game", "VERY COOL GAME LOTS OF CHEATERS AND HEAD ACHES :)))", "This is very good game, highly recommend this game", "Love & Hate relationship", "\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u043f", "maistuu salami", "NICE GAME \nMUST PLAY ONCE IN YOUR LIFETIME", "good game", "shit gamer", "they should make the knife droppable", "garbage", "very fun", "The best game", "this is doo doo game for little kid", "Good game but a lot of toxic russians :(.", "fun fun fun", "ITS OK", "sicko", "cs:go can ever be a fun game :3\n", "gud game", "nice game,but still best 1.6 <3\n", "good game", "dawdawdadad", "Really great game.

Aqu\u00ed no hay lugar para el factor suerte, obviamente dejando de lado al timing. El juego siempre ofrece las mismas herramientas a todos los jugadores, por lo que al final casi siempre acaban ganando los que mejor saben jugar. Olv\u00eddense de cualquier FPS moderno y todas sus innovaciones. Aqu\u00ed las horas de juego se traducen en m\u00e1s experiencia \"real\", somos mejores porque al jugar m\u00e1s hemos aprendido sus mec\u00e1nicas, el funcionamiento de las armas y los puntos estrat\u00e9gicos del mapa, pensar en lo que puede o no puede hacer el enemigo, no porque un sistema nos d\u00e9 ventajas artificiales.\n\nPara los nuevos jugadores, les digo que si juegan este nuevo campo de batalla y vienen de otros Shooters actuales como Call of Duty, lo mejor que pueden hacer es olvidar todo lo que han aprendido en esos juegos. Aqu\u00ed se dispara desde la cadera y si quieres apuntar solo podr\u00e1s hacerlo con las armas que tengan zoom; no hay regeneraci\u00f3n de vida autom\u00e1tica, por lo que todo el da\u00f1o que recibamos ser\u00e1 permanente, y no existen reapariciones, por lo que si nos matan no volveremos a la acci\u00f3n hasta la siguiente ronda (dejando dm y carrera de armamento de lado)\n\nB\u00e1sicamente, el juego nos propone unirnos al equipo de los terroristas (tt) o al de los anti-terroristas (ct). Dependiendo del mapa en el que nos encontremos, los terroristas tendr\u00e1n que poner una bomba y detonarla o los anti-terroristas tendr\u00e1n que rescatar a unos rehenes. Todo esto dentro del l\u00edmite de tiempo fijado. Para ganar tenemos o que cumplir el objetivo o matar a todo el equipo contrario. F\u00e1cil, simple de entender, y con una profundidad jugable que ha marcado una \u00e9poca.\n\n\nSi vamos correteando por ah\u00ed disparando a lo loco y contando con que acertaremos alguna bala, acabaremos muertos una y otra vez. Si queremos sobrevivir tendremos que estar constantemente pendientes del radar, jugar en equipo con el resto de nuestros compa\u00f1eros, saber que si llevamos el cuchillo correremos m\u00e1s, tender emboscadas para agarrar por sorpresa, ser conscientes de que cuando estemos agachados mejoramos nuestra precisi\u00f3n, calcular muy bien cuando recargar, etc.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, cada ronda iremos ganando dinero, ya sea por matar rivales, ganar, perder, rescatar rehenes o desactivar bombas.

It does not feel like the exception; it feels like the rule. Indeed, some days I haven't even had a clean match based on how many of my prior matches have a convicted cheater in them.

However, a majority of that time spent has been in casual matches due to only being able to solo queue). As for the game itself it can be good fun just to dive straight into a server and get the satisfaction of tapping heads.\n\nHowever for both casual and competitive matches [i]it really is[/i] no place for anyone wanting to queue solo and, of course, it can be the same for other multiplayer games but not as bad as this game; that's for sure. As a prime example you most definitely and unfortunately will come across a player that will cheat as well as players that may not understand English which makes it a worse experience since communication is [b]key[/b] to truly work together as a team.\n\nIn addition to that, you may also either be matched up with players who are unfriendly and not showing good sportsmanship which only encourages negative mentality and stops you from fully focusing on the match.\n\nAlso I would like to mention, and I'm sure many people know this already, that this game also contains quite a few bugs such as not being able to hit a player whilst standing still and / or crouching aiming at their head.

Relative to modern shooters it is worse in about every aspect imaginable. 50% of the time no matter what your trust factor is you will get put in a game with a cheater, and you can't do anything but get an ass whooping for 40 minutes or abandon the match and get a competitive ban. What's worse is the fact that they have removed bots from competitive for LITERALLY no reason so an enemy team has no insentive to kick their cheater. That is, if they could even kick them. Not even an hour ago I was against a queue where 3 people were partied together blatantly walling and bhop scripting on mirage. My entire team played the game dead silent not even shooting at people most of the time. This game has been on a downwards slope for years and now genuinely makes me want to go back to source and/or 1.6. If you want to play this game competitively then you have to do it through a 3rd party org who will most likely pay for you to have a reasonable experience. At that point you may be thinking, this game should be alright now right? Wrong. High level faceit is mostly full of closet cheaters who play the game to win tournament money. This game is so fucking far into the abyss that I don't even see how Valve can fix it. They finally made it where you have to pay for prime now. That must be a step in the right direction right? Sure, but the hundreds of thousands of free accounts who got to level 21 using cheats got grandfathered in. I really hope Valve can salvage this game because they are doing so little over so long (and boy do I mean so so so long).\n\nanyways 9/10 this game is fun", "played it a bit, it's ok", "Well after many hours in the game,\nHave to say that the game is fun but gives you Mental illnesses.\nCan't stop to play i am an ADDICT.\nEvery Sunday i am going to a group therapy.\nThank you", "Well structured, competitive and fun game. However, CSGO environment has became toxic with the never ending waves of hackers. Don't bother to spend money in this game or consider buying premium since CSGO has no permanent solution towards the hackers so the game is very unfair and no fun when there's hackers.", "Game is overall a great game depending on many factors, which i will go over in this review. To start with this isn't a game you can just jump into and be #1, it takes a lot of practice, time and commitment. Overall i've played this game for 2,400+ hours combined between my multiple accounts. I have personally loved this game for what it has to offer and have always been a fan of the game-mode and the genre of the game.\n\nI will be going over the positives and negatives in this review as well as summing it up at the end with my overall thoughts and opinions. I will admit this game isn't for the light hearted, as the community is a fairly toxic but also pleasant community. I have made many friends but also dealt with a lot of childish players within this game. You will be able to make friends quite easily and play with them constantly making it easier to rank up as your playing with people you can communicate with rather then random people.\n\nThere are a few key points to this game that make it amazing those are, team work, communication, skill, knowledge and memory. Team work is a vital part of this game and is what makes it amazing, it's a lot harder to win when you aren't playing as a team, any great team requires great communication, communication is an important part, as well as knowing what to call and when to call it. This game requires some skill, at the higher levels a lot more skill. This doesn't necessarily mean you need to be the best, as there are ranks in competitive for a reason to assign you to people in similar ranks, although there are smurfs and cheaters as with any competitive game. Knowledge and memory go together, can't have one without the other in this game, you need to be knowledgeable in how to peek, where to peek, how to peek together and more similar situations, to top it off you also need good memory in where to smoke, how to smoke certain positions, as well as flashbangs and other utilities.\n\nIn saying that, that is mainly only the competitive side of this game, there are many other amazing features offered in this game, those being community servers, arms races, demolition, casual and other gamemodes. This game has a lot to offer, in particular one of my favourite parts of this game is the community servers, you have surf servers, and game servers, making it a game for everyone.\n\nIf you are feeling like taking your gaming to the next level i would highly recommend this game, there are many leagues to join i.e FaceIT and similar. There is also the pro scene which many make it to in different divisions, this allows for the best of the best to play for cash and other rewards.\n\nThis game has no real pay to win features besides when the game requires you to now pay for prime, which is totally worth it! There are skins, but those do not have any advantage besides player models which can make it harder to see the person which is playing.\n\nNow i will give you all a lovely bullet point list of what this has to offer quickly ran down with negatives and positives below:\n\nThe Negatives:\n1) The Community - This will be featured in both areas, as it is a downfall and a positive, the community can be quite toxic but also quite welcoming.\n2) Learning Curve - There is a learning curve for this game, so don't expect to jump in and be rambo.\n3) The Cheaters - This comes with any game, but in this game there is a chance you will run into cheaters quite frequently.\n\nThe Positives:\n1) Amazing Game - This game is always going to be a top game and very popular at that.\n2) Requires Co-operation - This game i personally enjoy for the fact it requires the team to work as a team.\n3) Fun Combat - The guns have recoil patterns to learn, getting a good one tap is quite fun. Overall combat is a great aspect of this game.\n4) Top Selling Game - This game is a top selling game for a reason, allowing all sorts of players from all over to play an amazing FPS.\n\nThats the good and bad quickly summed up, i will be updating this review as time goes on. I hope you all enjoyed and if you have any questions feel free to leave them below and I will get to you as soon as i can. If you are looking for a game to have some fun then this is the game for you, aslong as you know what your in for.

The game has a serious and ongoing hacker and smurfing problem, and even if someone isn't cheating, it's hard to play against anyone good without seriously questioning if they are using some kind of third party cheat. The game is fun to play about half of the time.\n\nI am definitely no where near top skill in this game, I only place GN, but it's hard to play competitively or even just for fun at all anymore when you always have to live in fear of someone cheating the system to ruin your day. While obviously not every match you place into is going to have a cheater or a smurf, after playing for long such matches appear enough to tarnish the whole experience.\n\nI still won't recommend you play Valorant though.", "I started playing CSGO a while back and basically play war games to get the yearly badge.  I'm not the greatest and I know there are players better than me, but when you have a player running up the stairs and they shoot you while their back is to you and kill you, something is going on.  Or you have another player who takes on 3 players of the enemy team and mows them down like nothing and continues playing.  Also, the AFKers who are continually dragged from one match to another (and no, they aren't turning in circles, they are just standing there) and their friends won't kick them, something needs to be done about this.\n\nBut the worse thing is the people with a high ping (over 150 or more) when the rest of the players are at 15-40 ping.  Why are these people even allowed to join these matches.  Also, with all the thousands of people in this game, why do I continually get placed with the same 7-10 players where I can't get kills because either my teammates or the other team are getting 16 - 22 headshots or more?  I left the game once and didn't play for six months, but I'm just after the badge, but finding it may not be worth it as Valve's anti-cheat isn't very effective.", "many cheaters", "The game is toxic and has to many cheaters.

I got the game for my son because he wanted to play it with his friends and I think playing this game with his friends made them closer. He gets out of the house a lot too with his friends and only spends some of his free time playing video games. I approve of this game because he seems to enjoy it and it has no negative effect on him or any of the kids that I know that play it too and it\u2019s all about strategy and competition and has

Please tell me how I can accomplish achievements: 1) Veteran of map Aztec, 2) Veteran of map Dust , 3) Veteran of map Shorttrain, 4) This Glass World, 5) Sniper, 6) Tourist when you removed these 3 maps, thereby making these achievements unworkable. I hope to hear an adequate answer from you, since I really do not understand what the problem is: you have deleted maps, delete achievements, do not want to delete achievements, add maps back. + The game is actively supported by developers, updates are coming out. I encounter such a problem for the first time and for my understanding it is nonsense when game developers remove game content so plus tied to achievements. I perform all games on 100% ONLY HONESTLY and how can I perform these achievements when they are broken?\n\nAnswer from Steam support:\n\nWe are currently aware that certain achievements are no longer able to be obtained due to the maps being removed from the game. Unfortunately, we cannot provide a workaround for obtaining these achievements but I have forwarded your concerns on this matter onto the CS:GO team so they're aware. \n\nPlease let us know if you have any other questions or issues that we may assist you with.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nThe developer has done nothing since 2017 when they have broken these 6 achievement. Maybe it is new fashion, break something that is working good. I want you to know only one thing if you ignore the quality of your project remember that this is the way to nowhere. I hope that there is at least 1 person in your development team who understands and will correct this problem.\n\nAbout the game:\n\nThe very good game. Didn't meet any bugs. The game engine gives us the very good picture.

AWP seems very OP...\n\nHello folks, just got the game today from the steam sale. Not completely new to CS, I've owned CSS for a few years now but only because it was on sale bundled with gmod which is what I was really after, though still a fun game that I'd play a few times a month.\n\nOnce thing I've noticed about almost every CSS server I've played on is every sniper but the Scout is banned, for good reason I thought since when I went into servers where they weren't banned no one was using anything but these weapons (mostly the AWP). In a game about making twitch precision headshots, the AWP seems to break it since you don't need to be very precise with it at all.\n\nMy experience with the AWP in CSS is actually why I've put off buying CS GO for so long. I knew that you get into most games through matchmaking meaning you have to deal with AWPS, and I feared most games would be reduced to everyone using AWPS vs everyone using AWPS, with people not using AWPS gettings shit on unless they're miles better than the enemy team. I ended up buying the game anyway today though since it's cheap and very popular.\n\nTurns out my fears were completely justified. The AWP completely breaks the game. All skill goes out the window once you can afford an AWP, just take a seat and anyone who approaches you instantly dies. Honestly I'm really disappointing and I'm already starting to regret this purchase, since I have a lot more fun in CSS where there are mostly no AWPS.\n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way about this weapon? I feel like the game would be so much better off without it. This one weapon is so game breaking that most CSS servers ban it, and this single weapon alone being legal has discouraged me from buying this entire game. I'm sure at the top 5% of play AWPS are balanced and natural part of the game... and CS elitists are going to have a field day with my \"noobish\" complaints, but honestly I don't give a shit :\\ because 95% of players aren't the top 5%.", "marf.", "Very good game, has good Mechanics, easy to get use to, affordable when u want, mm is easy and wm is even more easy , i rate this game a 9/10 u should buy it, it dosnt hurt to try another game other than fortnite :)\n\n- - -[Audience] - - -\n\u2610 Your Mom probably would enjoy this\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Everyone\n\u2611 Everyone except kids\n\u2611 Casual players\n\u2611 Pro players\n\u2611 People who plan to take one game and make it their life\n\n- - - [graphics] - - -\n\n\u2610 I want to poor bleach in my eyes\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\u2610 Bad, but playable.\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\n---[price]---\n\u2611 Free\n\u2610 Buy now\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2610 Wait for sale\n\u2610 Maybe if you have some spare money left\n\u2610 Do not buy it\n\u2610 Do not throw money into a trash can\n\n- - - [specs] - - -\n\n\u2611 Minimum\n\u2610 Medium\n\u2610 High end\n\u2610 NASA computer\n\n- - - [skill] - - -\n\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Average (Depends on the difficulty set)\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Only the best of the best can complete this game\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2611 Nothing\n\u2611 Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 A bit grindy...sometimes\n\u2610 Practically a full time job\n\n- - - [gameplay] - - -\n\n\u2611 Only gameplay, doesn't include a story.\n\u2610 There is a story, but most of the game is focused on gameplay.\n\u2610 Better than nothing I suppose...\n\u2610 Average.\n\u2610 Decent.\n\u2610 Amazing!\n\u2610 It\u2018ll replace your life\n\n- - - [bugs] - - -\n\n\u2610 Game itself is one big BUG\n\u2610 Lot of bugs (Can get annoying)\n\u2611 Few Bugs\n\u2610 You can use them for speedrun\n\u2610 Nothing (I've seen)\n\n---[time]---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of tea\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Not too short\n\u2611 Depends on you\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 Very Long\n\u2611 Endless\n\n- - - [length] - - -\n\u2610 One long, tedious grind\n\u2610 Better than mobile\n\u2610 Fun at first, but gets old quick\n\u2610 Consistently fun\n\u2611 Can't stop playing, even though I should be finished.", "good game", "apart fomr the constant russians telling me to f*** my mum its a great game", "i am black", "best game ngl so much better than valorant", "Give me knife or i will kill you all :)", "Great matchmaking", "good game", "It's Good.\n", "got better", "veyr tresh :(", "BEST OF THE BEST", "+ rep good game", "Nice Game", " so hhalalal mode so mcuh fun!", "Amazing game, as usual!", "Pls no", "liked it", "There are a lot of cheaters but still ok", "dancers", "nice game \ud83d\udc9c", "Very good BUM BUM nice skin BAM BAM yes", "Best game ever!!!", "nice game", "I got shot", "This game took all my money...", "Awesome if cheaters going off 4 just a hour", "FUN game try it out just try it out its a super fun game", "Love it, been playing for a looooong time", "pretty cool game", "cool game\n", "Game is very nice its my second time playing it <3", "this game good", "str8 banger bro", "every time i play comp, i get kicked while iam doing good, last game i played it was 15-7 til us and they kicked me, nice game", "bad game", "Good Game", "good game", "VERY COOL GAME LOTS OF CHEATERS AND HEAD ACHES :)))", "This is very good game, highly recommend this game", "Love & Hate relationship", "\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u043f", "maistuu salami", "NICE GAME \nMUST PLAY ONCE IN YOUR LIFETIME", "good game", "shit gamer", "they should make the knife droppable", "garbage", "very fun", "The best game", "this is doo doo game for little kid", "Good game but a lot of toxic russians :(.", "fun fun fun", "ITS OK", "sicko", "cs:go can ever be a fun game :3\n", "gud game", "nice game,but still best 1.6 <3\n", "good game", "dawdawdadad", "Really great game.

It does not feel like the exception; it feels like the rule. Indeed, some days I haven't even had a clean match based on how many of my prior matches have a convicted cheater in them.

However, a majority of that time spent has been in casual matches due to only being able to solo queue). As for the game itself it can be good fun just to dive straight into a server and get the satisfaction of tapping heads.\n\nHowever for both casual and competitive matches [i]it really is[/i] no place for anyone wanting to queue solo and, of course, it can be the same for other multiplayer games but not as bad as this game; that's for sure. As a prime example you most definitely and unfortunately will come across a player that will cheat as well as players that may not understand English which makes it a worse experience since communication is [b]key[/b] to truly work together as a team.\n\nIn addition to that, you may also either be matched up with players who are unfriendly and not showing good sportsmanship which only encourages negative mentality and stops you from fully focusing on the match.\n\nAlso I would like to mention, and I'm sure many people know this already, that this game also contains quite a few bugs such as not being able to hit a player whilst standing still and / or crouching aiming at their head.

Relative to modern shooters it is worse in about every aspect imaginable. 50% of the time no matter what your trust factor is you will get put in a game with a cheater, and you can't do anything but get an ass whooping for 40 minutes or abandon the match and get a competitive ban. What's worse is the fact that they have removed bots from competitive for LITERALLY no reason so an enemy team has no insentive to kick their cheater. That is, if they could even kick them. Not even an hour ago I was against a queue where 3 people were partied together blatantly walling and bhop scripting on mirage. My entire team played the game dead silent not even shooting at people most of the time. This game has been on a downwards slope for years and now genuinely makes me want to go back to source and/or 1.6. If you want to play this game competitively then you have to do it through a 3rd party org who will most likely pay for you to have a reasonable experience. At that point you may be thinking, this game should be alright now right? Wrong. High level faceit is mostly full of closet cheaters who play the game to win tournament money. This game is so fucking far into the abyss that I don't even see how Valve can fix it. They finally made it where you have to pay for prime now. That must be a step in the right direction right? Sure, but the hundreds of thousands of free accounts who got to level 21 using cheats got grandfathered in. I really hope Valve can salvage this game because they are doing so little over so long (and boy do I mean so so so long).\n\nanyways 9/10 this game is fun", "played it a bit, it's ok", "Well after many hours in the game,\nHave to say that the game is fun but gives you Mental illnesses.\nCan't stop to play i am an ADDICT.\nEvery Sunday i am going to a group therapy.\nThank you", "Well structured, competitive and fun game. However, CSGO environment has became toxic with the never ending waves of hackers. Don't bother to spend money in this game or consider buying premium since CSGO has no permanent solution towards the hackers so the game is very unfair and no fun when there's hackers.", "Game is overall a great game depending on many factors, which i will go over in this review. To start with this isn't a game you can just jump into and be #1, it takes a lot of practice, time and commitment. Overall i've played this game for 2,400+ hours combined between my multiple accounts. I have personally loved this game for what it has to offer and have always been a fan of the game-mode and the genre of the game.\n\nI will be going over the positives and negatives in this review as well as summing it up at the end with my overall thoughts and opinions. I will admit this game isn't for the light hearted, as the community is a fairly toxic but also pleasant community. I have made many friends but also dealt with a lot of childish players within this game. You will be able to make friends quite easily and play with them constantly making it easier to rank up as your playing with people you can communicate with rather then random people.\n\nThere are a few key points to this game that make it amazing those are, team work, communication, skill, knowledge and memory. Team work is a vital part of this game and is what makes it amazing, it's a lot harder to win when you aren't playing as a team, any great team requires great communication, communication is an important part, as well as knowing what to call and when to call it. This game requires some skill, at the higher levels a lot more skill. This doesn't necessarily mean you need to be the best, as there are ranks in competitive for a reason to assign you to people in similar ranks, although there are smurfs and cheaters as with any competitive game. Knowledge and memory go together, can't have one without the other in this game, you need to be knowledgeable in how to peek, where to peek, how to peek together and more similar situations, to top it off you also need good memory in where to smoke, how to smoke certain positions, as well as flashbangs and other utilities.\n\nIn saying that, that is mainly only the competitive side of this game, there are many other amazing features offered in this game, those being community servers, arms races, demolition, casual and other gamemodes. This game has a lot to offer, in particular one of my favourite parts of this game is the community servers, you have surf servers, and game servers, making it a game for everyone.\n\nIf you are feeling like taking your gaming to the next level i would highly recommend this game, there are many leagues to join i.e FaceIT and similar. There is also the pro scene which many make it to in different divisions, this allows for the best of the best to play for cash and other rewards.\n\nThis game has no real pay to win features besides when the game requires you to now pay for prime, which is totally worth it! There are skins, but those do not have any advantage besides player models which can make it harder to see the person which is playing.\n\nNow i will give you all a lovely bullet point list of what this has to offer quickly ran down with negatives and positives below:\n\nThe Negatives:\n1) The Community - This will be featured in both areas, as it is a downfall and a positive, the community can be quite toxic but also quite welcoming.\n2) Learning Curve - There is a learning curve for this game, so don't expect to jump in and be rambo.\n3) The Cheaters - This comes with any game, but in this game there is a chance you will run into cheaters quite frequently.\n\nThe Positives:\n1) Amazing Game - This game is always going to be a top game and very popular at that.\n2) Requires Co-operation - This game i personally enjoy for the fact it requires the team to work as a team.\n3) Fun Combat - The guns have recoil patterns to learn, getting a good one tap is quite fun. Overall combat is a great aspect of this game.\n4) Top Selling Game - This game is a top selling game for a reason, allowing all sorts of players from all over to play an amazing FPS.\n\nThats the good and bad quickly summed up, i will be updating this review as time goes on. I hope you all enjoyed and if you have any questions feel free to leave them below and I will get to you as soon as i can. If you are looking for a game to have some fun then this is the game for you, aslong as you know what your in for.

The game has a serious and ongoing hacker and smurfing problem, and even if someone isn't cheating, it's hard to play against anyone good without seriously questioning if they are using some kind of third party cheat. The game is fun to play about half of the time.\n\nI am definitely no where near top skill in this game, I only place GN, but it's hard to play competitively or even just for fun at all anymore when you always have to live in fear of someone cheating the system to ruin your day. While obviously not every match you place into is going to have a cheater or a smurf, after playing for long such matches appear enough to tarnish the whole experience.\n\nI still won't recommend you play Valorant though.", "I started playing CSGO a while back and basically play war games to get the yearly badge.  I'm not the greatest and I know there are players better than me, but when you have a player running up the stairs and they shoot you while their back is to you and kill you, something is going on.  Or you have another player who takes on 3 players of the enemy team and mows them down like nothing and continues playing.  Also, the AFKers who are continually dragged from one match to another (and no, they aren't turning in circles, they are just standing there) and their friends won't kick them, something needs to be done about this.\n\nBut the worse thing is the people with a high ping (over 150 or more) when the rest of the players are at 15-40 ping.  Why are these people even allowed to join these matches.  Also, with all the thousands of people in this game, why do I continually get placed with the same 7-10 players where I can't get kills because either my teammates or the other team are getting 16 - 22 headshots or more?  I left the game once and didn't play for six months, but I'm just after the badge, but finding it may not be worth it as Valve's anti-cheat isn't very effective.", "many cheaters", "The game is toxic and has to many cheaters.

I got the game for my son because he wanted to play it with his friends and I think playing this game with his friends made them closer. He gets out of the house a lot too with his friends and only spends some of his free time playing video games. I approve of this game because he seems to enjoy it and it has no negative effect on him or any of the kids that I know that play it too and it\u2019s all about strategy and competition and has

Please tell me how I can accomplish achievements: 1) Veteran of map Aztec, 2) Veteran of map Dust , 3) Veteran of map Shorttrain, 4) This Glass World, 5) Sniper, 6) Tourist when you removed these 3 maps, thereby making these achievements unworkable. I hope to hear an adequate answer from you, since I really do not understand what the problem is: you have deleted maps, delete achievements, do not want to delete achievements, add maps back. + The game is actively supported by developers, updates are coming out. I encounter such a problem for the first time and for my understanding it is nonsense when game developers remove game content so plus tied to achievements. I perform all games on 100% ONLY HONESTLY and how can I perform these achievements when they are broken?\n\nAnswer from Steam support:\n\nWe are currently aware that certain achievements are no longer able to be obtained due to the maps being removed from the game. Unfortunately, we cannot provide a workaround for obtaining these achievements but I have forwarded your concerns on this matter onto the CS:GO team so they're aware. \n\nPlease let us know if you have any other questions or issues that we may assist you with.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nThe developer has done nothing since 2017 when they have broken these 6 achievement. Maybe it is new fashion, break something that is working good. I want you to know only one thing if you ignore the quality of your project remember that this is the way to nowhere. I hope that there is at least 1 person in your development team who understands and will correct this problem.\n\nAbout the game:\n\nThe very good game. Didn't meet any bugs. The game engine gives us the very good picture.

AWP seems very OP...\n\nHello folks, just got the game today from the steam sale. Not completely new to CS, I've owned CSS for a few years now but only because it was on sale bundled with gmod which is what I was really after, though still a fun game that I'd play a few times a month.\n\nOnce thing I've noticed about almost every CSS server I've played on is every sniper but the Scout is banned, for good reason I thought since when I went into servers where they weren't banned no one was using anything but these weapons (mostly the AWP). In a game about making twitch precision headshots, the AWP seems to break it since you don't need to be very precise with it at all.\n\nMy experience with the AWP in CSS is actually why I've put off buying CS GO for so long. I knew that you get into most games through matchmaking meaning you have to deal with AWPS, and I feared most games would be reduced to everyone using AWPS vs everyone using AWPS, with people not using AWPS gettings shit on unless they're miles better than the enemy team. I ended up buying the game anyway today though since it's cheap and very popular.\n\nTurns out my fears were completely justified. The AWP completely breaks the game. All skill goes out the window once you can afford an AWP, just take a seat and anyone who approaches you instantly dies. Honestly I'm really disappointing and I'm already starting to regret this purchase, since I have a lot more fun in CSS where there are mostly no AWPS.\n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way about this weapon? I feel like the game would be so much better off without it. This one weapon is so game breaking that most CSS servers ban it, and this single weapon alone being legal has discouraged me from buying this entire game. I'm sure at the top 5% of play AWPS are balanced and natural part of the game... and CS elitists are going to have a field day with my \"noobish\" complaints, but honestly I don't give a shit :\\ because 95% of players aren't the top 5%.", "marf.", "Very good game, has good Mechanics, easy to get use to, affordable when u want, mm is easy and wm is even more easy , i rate this game a 9/10 u should buy it, it dosnt hurt to try another game other than fortnite :)\n\n- - -[Audience] - - -\n\u2610 Your Mom probably would enjoy this\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Everyone\n\u2611 Everyone except kids\n\u2611 Casual players\n\u2611 Pro players\n\u2611 People who plan to take one game and make it their life\n\n- - - [graphics] - - -\n\n\u2610 I want to poor bleach in my eyes\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\u2610 Bad, but playable.\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\n---[price]---\n\u2611 Free\n\u2610 Buy now\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2610 Wait for sale\n\u2610 Maybe if you have some spare money left\n\u2610 Do not buy it\n\u2610 Do not throw money into a trash can\n\n- - - [specs] - - -\n\n\u2611 Minimum\n\u2610 Medium\n\u2610 High end\n\u2610 NASA computer\n\n- - - [skill] - - -\n\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Average (Depends on the difficulty set)\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Only the best of the best can complete this game\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2611 Nothing\n\u2611 Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 A bit grindy...sometimes\n\u2610 Practically a full time job\n\n- - - [gameplay] - - -\n\n\u2611 Only gameplay, doesn't include a story.\n\u2610 There is a story, but most of the game is focused on gameplay.\n\u2610 Better than nothing I suppose...\n\u2610 Average.\n\u2610 Decent.\n\u2610 Amazing!\n\u2610 It\u2018ll replace your life\n\n- - - [bugs] - - -\n\n\u2610 Game itself is one big BUG\n\u2610 Lot of bugs (Can get annoying)\n\u2611 Few Bugs\n\u2610 You can use them for speedrun\n\u2610 Nothing (I've seen)\n\n---[time]---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of tea\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Not too short\n\u2611 Depends on you\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 Very Long\n\u2611 Endless\n\n- - - [length] - - -\n\u2610 One long, tedious grind\n\u2610 Better than mobile\n\u2610 Fun at first, but gets old quick\n\u2610 Consistently fun\n\u2611 Can't stop playing, even though I should be finished.", "good game", "apart fomr the constant russians telling me to f*** my mum its a great game", "i am black", "best game ngl so much better than valorant", "Give me knife or i will kill you all :)", "Great matchmaking", "good game", "It's Good.\n", "got better", "veyr tresh :(", "BEST OF THE BEST", "+ rep good game", "Nice Game", " so hhalalal mode so mcuh fun!", "Amazing game, as usual!", "Pls no", "liked it", "There are a lot of cheaters but still ok", "dancers", "nice game \ud83d\udc9c", "Very good BUM BUM nice skin BAM BAM yes", "Best game ever!!!", "nice game", "I got shot", "This game took all my money...", "Awesome if cheaters going off 4 just a hour", "FUN game try it out just try it out its a super fun game", "Love it, been playing for a looooong time", "pretty cool game", "cool game\n", "Game is very nice its my second time playing it <3", "this game good", "str8 banger bro", "every time i play comp, i get kicked while iam doing good, last game i played it was 15-7 til us and they kicked me, nice game", "bad game", "Good Game", "good game", "VERY COOL GAME LOTS OF CHEATERS AND HEAD ACHES :)))", "This is very good game, highly recommend this game", "Love & Hate relationship", "\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u043f", "maistuu salami", "NICE GAME \nMUST PLAY ONCE IN YOUR LIFETIME", "good game", "shit gamer", "they should make the knife droppable", "garbage", "very fun", "The best game", "this is doo doo game for little kid", "Good game but a lot of toxic russians :(.", "fun fun fun", "ITS OK", "sicko", "cs:go can ever be a fun game :3\n", "gud game", "nice game,but still best 1.6 <3\n", "good game", "dawdawdadad", "Really great game.

It does not feel like the exception; it feels like the rule. Indeed, some days I haven't even had a clean match based on how many of my prior matches have a convicted cheater in them.

However, a majority of that time spent has been in casual matches due to only being able to solo queue). As for the game itself it can be good fun just to dive straight into a server and get the satisfaction of tapping heads.\n\nHowever for both casual and competitive matches [i]it really is[/i] no place for anyone wanting to queue solo and, of course, it can be the same for other multiplayer games but not as bad as this game; that's for sure. As a prime example you most definitely and unfortunately will come across a player that will cheat as well as players that may not understand English which makes it a worse experience since communication is [b]key[/b] to truly work together as a team.\n\nIn addition to that, you may also either be matched up with players who are unfriendly and not showing good sportsmanship which only encourages negative mentality and stops you from fully focusing on the match.\n\nAlso I would like to mention, and I'm sure many people know this already, that this game also contains quite a few bugs such as not being able to hit a player whilst standing still and / or crouching aiming at their head.

Relative to modern shooters it is worse in about every aspect imaginable. 50% of the time no matter what your trust factor is you will get put in a game with a cheater, and you can't do anything but get an ass whooping for 40 minutes or abandon the match and get a competitive ban. What's worse is the fact that they have removed bots from competitive for LITERALLY no reason so an enemy team has no insentive to kick their cheater. That is, if they could even kick them. Not even an hour ago I was against a queue where 3 people were partied together blatantly walling and bhop scripting on mirage. My entire team played the game dead silent not even shooting at people most of the time. This game has been on a downwards slope for years and now genuinely makes me want to go back to source and/or 1.6. If you want to play this game competitively then you have to do it through a 3rd party org who will most likely pay for you to have a reasonable experience. At that point you may be thinking, this game should be alright now right? Wrong. High level faceit is mostly full of closet cheaters who play the game to win tournament money. This game is so fucking far into the abyss that I don't even see how Valve can fix it. They finally made it where you have to pay for prime now. That must be a step in the right direction right? Sure, but the hundreds of thousands of free accounts who got to level 21 using cheats got grandfathered in. I really hope Valve can salvage this game because they are doing so little over so long (and boy do I mean so so so long).\n\nanyways 9/10 this game is fun", "played it a bit, it's ok", "Well after many hours in the game,\nHave to say that the game is fun but gives you Mental illnesses.\nCan't stop to play i am an ADDICT.\nEvery Sunday i am going to a group therapy.\nThank you", "Well structured, competitive and fun game. However, CSGO environment has became toxic with the never ending waves of hackers. Don't bother to spend money in this game or consider buying premium since CSGO has no permanent solution towards the hackers so the game is very unfair and no fun when there's hackers.", "Game is overall a great game depending on many factors, which i will go over in this review. To start with this isn't a game you can just jump into and be #1, it takes a lot of practice, time and commitment. Overall i've played this game for 2,400+ hours combined between my multiple accounts. I have personally loved this game for what it has to offer and have always been a fan of the game-mode and the genre of the game.\n\nI will be going over the positives and negatives in this review as well as summing it up at the end with my overall thoughts and opinions. I will admit this game isn't for the light hearted, as the community is a fairly toxic but also pleasant community. I have made many friends but also dealt with a lot of childish players within this game. You will be able to make friends quite easily and play with them constantly making it easier to rank up as your playing with people you can communicate with rather then random people.\n\nThere are a few key points to this game that make it amazing those are, team work, communication, skill, knowledge and memory. Team work is a vital part of this game and is what makes it amazing, it's a lot harder to win when you aren't playing as a team, any great team requires great communication, communication is an important part, as well as knowing what to call and when to call it. This game requires some skill, at the higher levels a lot more skill. This doesn't necessarily mean you need to be the best, as there are ranks in competitive for a reason to assign you to people in similar ranks, although there are smurfs and cheaters as with any competitive game. Knowledge and memory go together, can't have one without the other in this game, you need to be knowledgeable in how to peek, where to peek, how to peek together and more similar situations, to top it off you also need good memory in where to smoke, how to smoke certain positions, as well as flashbangs and other utilities.\n\nIn saying that, that is mainly only the competitive side of this game, there are many other amazing features offered in this game, those being community servers, arms races, demolition, casual and other gamemodes. This game has a lot to offer, in particular one of my favourite parts of this game is the community servers, you have surf servers, and game servers, making it a game for everyone.\n\nIf you are feeling like taking your gaming to the next level i would highly recommend this game, there are many leagues to join i.e FaceIT and similar. There is also the pro scene which many make it to in different divisions, this allows for the best of the best to play for cash and other rewards.\n\nThis game has no real pay to win features besides when the game requires you to now pay for prime, which is totally worth it! There are skins, but those do not have any advantage besides player models which can make it harder to see the person which is playing.\n\nNow i will give you all a lovely bullet point list of what this has to offer quickly ran down with negatives and positives below:\n\nThe Negatives:\n1) The Community - This will be featured in both areas, as it is a downfall and a positive, the community can be quite toxic but also quite welcoming.\n2) Learning Curve - There is a learning curve for this game, so don't expect to jump in and be rambo.\n3) The Cheaters - This comes with any game, but in this game there is a chance you will run into cheaters quite frequently.\n\nThe Positives:\n1) Amazing Game - This game is always going to be a top game and very popular at that.\n2) Requires Co-operation - This game i personally enjoy for the fact it requires the team to work as a team.\n3) Fun Combat - The guns have recoil patterns to learn, getting a good one tap is quite fun. Overall combat is a great aspect of this game.\n4) Top Selling Game - This game is a top selling game for a reason, allowing all sorts of players from all over to play an amazing FPS.\n\nThats the good and bad quickly summed up, i will be updating this review as time goes on. I hope you all enjoyed and if you have any questions feel free to leave them below and I will get to you as soon as i can. If you are looking for a game to have some fun then this is the game for you, aslong as you know what your in for.

The game has a serious and ongoing hacker and smurfing problem, and even if someone isn't cheating, it's hard to play against anyone good without seriously questioning if they are using some kind of third party cheat. The game is fun to play about half of the time.\n\nI am definitely no where near top skill in this game, I only place GN, but it's hard to play competitively or even just for fun at all anymore when you always have to live in fear of someone cheating the system to ruin your day. While obviously not every match you place into is going to have a cheater or a smurf, after playing for long such matches appear enough to tarnish the whole experience.\n\nI still won't recommend you play Valorant though.", "I started playing CSGO a while back and basically play war games to get the yearly badge.  I'm not the greatest and I know there are players better than me, but when you have a player running up the stairs and they shoot you while their back is to you and kill you, something is going on.  Or you have another player who takes on 3 players of the enemy team and mows them down like nothing and continues playing.  Also, the AFKers who are continually dragged from one match to another (and no, they aren't turning in circles, they are just standing there) and their friends won't kick them, something needs to be done about this.\n\nBut the worse thing is the people with a high ping (over 150 or more) when the rest of the players are at 15-40 ping.  Why are these people even allowed to join these matches.  Also, with all the thousands of people in this game, why do I continually get placed with the same 7-10 players where I can't get kills because either my teammates or the other team are getting 16 - 22 headshots or more?  I left the game once and didn't play for six months, but I'm just after the badge, but finding it may not be worth it as Valve's anti-cheat isn't very effective.", "many cheaters", "The game is toxic and has to many cheaters.

I got the game for my son because he wanted to play it with his friends and I think playing this game with his friends made them closer. He gets out of the house a lot too with his friends and only spends some of his free time playing video games. I approve of this game because he seems to enjoy it and it has no negative effect on him or any of the kids that I know that play it too and it\u2019s all about strategy and competition and has

Please tell me how I can accomplish achievements: 1) Veteran of map Aztec, 2) Veteran of map Dust , 3) Veteran of map Shorttrain, 4) This Glass World, 5) Sniper, 6) Tourist when you removed these 3 maps, thereby making these achievements unworkable. I hope to hear an adequate answer from you, since I really do not understand what the problem is: you have deleted maps, delete achievements, do not want to delete achievements, add maps back. + The game is actively supported by developers, updates are coming out. I encounter such a problem for the first time and for my understanding it is nonsense when game developers remove game content so plus tied to achievements. I perform all games on 100% ONLY HONESTLY and how can I perform these achievements when they are broken?\n\nAnswer from Steam support:\n\nWe are currently aware that certain achievements are no longer able to be obtained due to the maps being removed from the game. Unfortunately, we cannot provide a workaround for obtaining these achievements but I have forwarded your concerns on this matter onto the CS:GO team so they're aware. \n\nPlease let us know if you have any other questions or issues that we may assist you with.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nThe developer has done nothing since 2017 when they have broken these 6 achievement. Maybe it is new fashion, break something that is working good. I want you to know only one thing if you ignore the quality of your project remember that this is the way to nowhere. I hope that there is at least 1 person in your development team who understands and will correct this problem.\n\nAbout the game:\n\nThe very good game. Didn't meet any bugs. The game engine gives us the very good picture.

AWP seems very OP...\n\nHello folks, just got the game today from the steam sale. Not completely new to CS, I've owned CSS for a few years now but only because it was on sale bundled with gmod which is what I was really after, though still a fun game that I'd play a few times a month.\n\nOnce thing I've noticed about almost every CSS server I've played on is every sniper but the Scout is banned, for good reason I thought since when I went into servers where they weren't banned no one was using anything but these weapons (mostly the AWP). In a game about making twitch precision headshots, the AWP seems to break it since you don't need to be very precise with it at all.\n\nMy experience with the AWP in CSS is actually why I've put off buying CS GO for so long. I knew that you get into most games through matchmaking meaning you have to deal with AWPS, and I feared most games would be reduced to everyone using AWPS vs everyone using AWPS, with people not using AWPS gettings shit on unless they're miles better than the enemy team. I ended up buying the game anyway today though since it's cheap and very popular.\n\nTurns out my fears were completely justified. The AWP completely breaks the game. All skill goes out the window once you can afford an AWP, just take a seat and anyone who approaches you instantly dies. Honestly I'm really disappointing and I'm already starting to regret this purchase, since I have a lot more fun in CSS where there are mostly no AWPS.\n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way about this weapon? I feel like the game would be so much better off without it. This one weapon is so game breaking that most CSS servers ban it, and this single weapon alone being legal has discouraged me from buying this entire game. I'm sure at the top 5% of play AWPS are balanced and natural part of the game... and CS elitists are going to have a field day with my \"noobish\" complaints, but honestly I don't give a shit :\\ because 95% of players aren't the top 5%.", "marf.", "Very good game, has good Mechanics, easy to get use to, affordable when u want, mm is easy and wm is even more easy , i rate this game a 9/10 u should buy it, it dosnt hurt to try another game other than fortnite :)\n\n- - -[Audience] - - -\n\u2610 Your Mom probably would enjoy this\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Everyone\n\u2611 Everyone except kids\n\u2611 Casual players\n\u2611 Pro players\n\u2611 People who plan to take one game and make it their life\n\n- - - [graphics] - - -\n\n\u2610 I want to poor bleach in my eyes\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\u2610 Bad, but playable.\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\n---[price]---\n\u2611 Free\n\u2610 Buy now\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2610 Wait for sale\n\u2610 Maybe if you have some spare money left\n\u2610 Do not buy it\n\u2610 Do not throw money into a trash can\n\n- - - [specs] - - -\n\n\u2611 Minimum\n\u2610 Medium\n\u2610 High end\n\u2610 NASA computer\n\n- - - [skill] - - -\n\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Average (Depends on the difficulty set)\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Only the best of the best can complete this game\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2611 Nothing\n\u2611 Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 A bit grindy...sometimes\n\u2610 Practically a full time job\n\n- - - [gameplay] - - -\n\n\u2611 Only gameplay, doesn't include a story.\n\u2610 There is a story, but most of the game is focused on gameplay.\n\u2610 Better than nothing I suppose...\n\u2610 Average.\n\u2610 Decent.\n\u2610 Amazing!\n\u2610 It\u2018ll replace your life\n\n- - - [bugs] - - -\n\n\u2610 Game itself is one big BUG\n\u2610 Lot of bugs (Can get annoying)\n\u2611 Few Bugs\n\u2610 You can use them for speedrun\n\u2610 Nothing (I've seen)\n\n---[time]---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of tea\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Not too short\n\u2611 Depends on you\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 Very Long\n\u2611 Endless\n\n- - - [length] - - -\n\u2610 One long, tedious grind\n\u2610 Better than mobile\n\u2610 Fun at first, but gets old quick\n\u2610 Consistently fun\n\u2611 Can't stop playing, even though I should be finished.", "good game", "apart fomr the constant russians telling me to f*** my mum its a great game", "i am black", "best game ngl so much better than valorant", "Give me knife or i will kill you all :)", "Great matchmaking", "good game", "It's Good.\n", "got better", "veyr tresh :(", "BEST OF THE BEST", "+ rep good game", "Nice Game", " so hhalalal mode so mcuh fun!", "Amazing game, as usual!", "Pls no", "liked it", "There are a lot of cheaters but still ok", "dancers", "nice game \ud83d\udc9c", "Very good BUM BUM nice skin BAM BAM yes", "Best game ever!!!", "nice game", "I got shot", "This game took all my money...", "Awesome if cheaters going off 4 just a hour", "FUN game try it out just try it out its a super fun game", "Love it, been playing for a looooong time", "pretty cool game", "cool game\n", "Game is very nice its my second time playing it <3", "this game good", "str8 banger bro", "every time i play comp, i get kicked while iam doing good, last game i played it was 15-7 til us and they kicked me, nice game", "bad game", "Good Game", "good game", "VERY COOL GAME LOTS OF CHEATERS AND HEAD ACHES :)))", "This is very good game, highly recommend this game", "Love & Hate relationship", "\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u043f", "maistuu salami", "NICE GAME \nMUST PLAY ONCE IN YOUR LIFETIME", "good game", "shit gamer", "they should make the knife droppable", "garbage", "very fun", "The best game", "this is doo doo game for little kid", "Good game but a lot of toxic russians :(.", "fun fun fun", "ITS OK", "sicko", "cs:go can ever be a fun game :3\n", "gud game", "nice game,but still best 1.6 <3\n", "good game", "dawdawdadad", "Really great game.

It does not feel like the exception; it feels like the rule. Indeed, some days I haven't even had a clean match based on how many of my prior matches have a convicted cheater in them.

However, a majority of that time spent has been in casual matches due to only being able to solo queue). As for the game itself it can be good fun just to dive straight into a server and get the satisfaction of tapping heads.\n\nHowever for both casual and competitive matches [i]it really is[/i] no place for anyone wanting to queue solo and, of course, it can be the same for other multiplayer games but not as bad as this game; that's for sure. As a prime example you most definitely and unfortunately will come across a player that will cheat as well as players that may not understand English which makes it a worse experience since communication is [b]key[/b] to truly work together as a team.\n\nIn addition to that, you may also either be matched up with players who are unfriendly and not showing good sportsmanship which only encourages negative mentality and stops you from fully focusing on the match.\n\nAlso I would like to mention, and I'm sure many people know this already, that this game also contains quite a few bugs such as not being able to hit a player whilst standing still and / or crouching aiming at their head.

Relative to modern shooters it is worse in about every aspect imaginable. 50% of the time no matter what your trust factor is you will get put in a game with a cheater, and you can't do anything but get an ass whooping for 40 minutes or abandon the match and get a competitive ban. What's worse is the fact that they have removed bots from competitive for LITERALLY no reason so an enemy team has no insentive to kick their cheater. That is, if they could even kick them. Not even an hour ago I was against a queue where 3 people were partied together blatantly walling and bhop scripting on mirage. My entire team played the game dead silent not even shooting at people most of the time. This game has been on a downwards slope for years and now genuinely makes me want to go back to source and/or 1.6. If you want to play this game competitively then you have to do it through a 3rd party org who will most likely pay for you to have a reasonable experience. At that point you may be thinking, this game should be alright now right? Wrong. High level faceit is mostly full of closet cheaters who play the game to win tournament money. This game is so fucking far into the abyss that I don't even see how Valve can fix it. They finally made it where you have to pay for prime now. That must be a step in the right direction right? Sure, but the hundreds of thousands of free accounts who got to level 21 using cheats got grandfathered in. I really hope Valve can salvage this game because they are doing so little over so long (and boy do I mean so so so long).\n\nanyways 9/10 this game is fun", "played it a bit, it's ok", "Well after many hours in the game,\nHave to say that the game is fun but gives you Mental illnesses.\nCan't stop to play i am an ADDICT.\nEvery Sunday i am going to a group therapy.\nThank you", "Well structured, competitive and fun game. However, CSGO environment has became toxic with the never ending waves of hackers. Don't bother to spend money in this game or consider buying premium since CSGO has no permanent solution towards the hackers so the game is very unfair and no fun when there's hackers.", "Game is overall a great game depending on many factors, which i will go over in this review. To start with this isn't a game you can just jump into and be #1, it takes a lot of practice, time and commitment. Overall i've played this game for 2,400+ hours combined between my multiple accounts. I have personally loved this game for what it has to offer and have always been a fan of the game-mode and the genre of the game.\n\nI will be going over the positives and negatives in this review as well as summing it up at the end with my overall thoughts and opinions. I will admit this game isn't for the light hearted, as the community is a fairly toxic but also pleasant community. I have made many friends but also dealt with a lot of childish players within this game. You will be able to make friends quite easily and play with them constantly making it easier to rank up as your playing with people you can communicate with rather then random people.\n\nThere are a few key points to this game that make it amazing those are, team work, communication, skill, knowledge and memory. Team work is a vital part of this game and is what makes it amazing, it's a lot harder to win when you aren't playing as a team, any great team requires great communication, communication is an important part, as well as knowing what to call and when to call it. This game requires some skill, at the higher levels a lot more skill. This doesn't necessarily mean you need to be the best, as there are ranks in competitive for a reason to assign you to people in similar ranks, although there are smurfs and cheaters as with any competitive game. Knowledge and memory go together, can't have one without the other in this game, you need to be knowledgeable in how to peek, where to peek, how to peek together and more similar situations, to top it off you also need good memory in where to smoke, how to smoke certain positions, as well as flashbangs and other utilities.\n\nIn saying that, that is mainly only the competitive side of this game, there are many other amazing features offered in this game, those being community servers, arms races, demolition, casual and other gamemodes. This game has a lot to offer, in particular one of my favourite parts of this game is the community servers, you have surf servers, and game servers, making it a game for everyone.\n\nIf you are feeling like taking your gaming to the next level i would highly recommend this game, there are many leagues to join i.e FaceIT and similar. There is also the pro scene which many make it to in different divisions, this allows for the best of the best to play for cash and other rewards.\n\nThis game has no real pay to win features besides when the game requires you to now pay for prime, which is totally worth it! There are skins, but those do not have any advantage besides player models which can make it harder to see the person which is playing.\n\nNow i will give you all a lovely bullet point list of what this has to offer quickly ran down with negatives and positives below:\n\nThe Negatives:\n1) The Community - This will be featured in both areas, as it is a downfall and a positive, the community can be quite toxic but also quite welcoming.\n2) Learning Curve - There is a learning curve for this game, so don't expect to jump in and be rambo.\n3) The Cheaters - This comes with any game, but in this game there is a chance you will run into cheaters quite frequently.\n\nThe Positives:\n1) Amazing Game - This game is always going to be a top game and very popular at that.\n2) Requires Co-operation - This game i personally enjoy for the fact it requires the team to work as a team.\n3) Fun Combat - The guns have recoil patterns to learn, getting a good one tap is quite fun. Overall combat is a great aspect of this game.\n4) Top Selling Game - This game is a top selling game for a reason, allowing all sorts of players from all over to play an amazing FPS.\n\nThats the good and bad quickly summed up, i will be updating this review as time goes on. I hope you all enjoyed and if you have any questions feel free to leave them below and I will get to you as soon as i can. If you are looking for a game to have some fun then this is the game for you, aslong as you know what your in for.

The game has a serious and ongoing hacker and smurfing problem, and even if someone isn't cheating, it's hard to play against anyone good without seriously questioning if they are using some kind of third party cheat. The game is fun to play about half of the time.\n\nI am definitely no where near top skill in this game, I only place GN, but it's hard to play competitively or even just for fun at all anymore when you always have to live in fear of someone cheating the system to ruin your day. While obviously not every match you place into is going to have a cheater or a smurf, after playing for long such matches appear enough to tarnish the whole experience.\n\nI still won't recommend you play Valorant though.", "I started playing CSGO a while back and basically play war games to get the yearly badge.  I'm not the greatest and I know there are players better than me, but when you have a player running up the stairs and they shoot you while their back is to you and kill you, something is going on.  Or you have another player who takes on 3 players of the enemy team and mows them down like nothing and continues playing.  Also, the AFKers who are continually dragged from one match to another (and no, they aren't turning in circles, they are just standing there) and their friends won't kick them, something needs to be done about this.\n\nBut the worse thing is the people with a high ping (over 150 or more) when the rest of the players are at 15-40 ping.  Why are these people even allowed to join these matches.  Also, with all the thousands of people in this game, why do I continually get placed with the same 7-10 players where I can't get kills because either my teammates or the other team are getting 16 - 22 headshots or more?  I left the game once and didn't play for six months, but I'm just after the badge, but finding it may not be worth it as Valve's anti-cheat isn't very effective.", "many cheaters", "The game is toxic and has to many cheaters.

I got the game for my son because he wanted to play it with his friends and I think playing this game with his friends made them closer. He gets out of the house a lot too with his friends and only spends some of his free time playing video games. I approve of this game because he seems to enjoy it and it has no negative effect on him or any of the kids that I know that play it too and it\u2019s all about strategy and competition and has

Please tell me how I can accomplish achievements: 1) Veteran of map Aztec, 2) Veteran of map Dust , 3) Veteran of map Shorttrain, 4) This Glass World, 5) Sniper, 6) Tourist when you removed these 3 maps, thereby making these achievements unworkable. I hope to hear an adequate answer from you, since I really do not understand what the problem is: you have deleted maps, delete achievements, do not want to delete achievements, add maps back. + The game is actively supported by developers, updates are coming out. I encounter such a problem for the first time and for my understanding it is nonsense when game developers remove game content so plus tied to achievements. I perform all games on 100% ONLY HONESTLY and how can I perform these achievements when they are broken?\n\nAnswer from Steam support:\n\nWe are currently aware that certain achievements are no longer able to be obtained due to the maps being removed from the game. Unfortunately, we cannot provide a workaround for obtaining these achievements but I have forwarded your concerns on this matter onto the CS:GO team so they're aware. \n\nPlease let us know if you have any other questions or issues that we may assist you with.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nThe developer has done nothing since 2017 when they have broken these 6 achievement. Maybe it is new fashion, break something that is working good. I want you to know only one thing if you ignore the quality of your project remember that this is the way to nowhere. I hope that there is at least 1 person in your development team who understands and will correct this problem.\n\nAbout the game:\n\nThe very good game. Didn't meet any bugs. The game engine gives us the very good picture.

AWP seems very OP...\n\nHello folks, just got the game today from the steam sale. Not completely new to CS, I've owned CSS for a few years now but only because it was on sale bundled with gmod which is what I was really after, though still a fun game that I'd play a few times a month.\n\nOnce thing I've noticed about almost every CSS server I've played on is every sniper but the Scout is banned, for good reason I thought since when I went into servers where they weren't banned no one was using anything but these weapons (mostly the AWP). In a game about making twitch precision headshots, the AWP seems to break it since you don't need to be very precise with it at all.\n\nMy experience with the AWP in CSS is actually why I've put off buying CS GO for so long. I knew that you get into most games through matchmaking meaning you have to deal with AWPS, and I feared most games would be reduced to everyone using AWPS vs everyone using AWPS, with people not using AWPS gettings shit on unless they're miles better than the enemy team. I ended up buying the game anyway today though since it's cheap and very popular.\n\nTurns out my fears were completely justified. The AWP completely breaks the game. All skill goes out the window once you can afford an AWP, just take a seat and anyone who approaches you instantly dies. Honestly I'm really disappointing and I'm already starting to regret this purchase, since I have a lot more fun in CSS where there are mostly no AWPS.\n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way about this weapon? I feel like the game would be so much better off without it. This one weapon is so game breaking that most CSS servers ban it, and this single weapon alone being legal has discouraged me from buying this entire game. I'm sure at the top 5% of play AWPS are balanced and natural part of the game... and CS elitists are going to have a field day with my \"noobish\" complaints, but honestly I don't give a shit :\\ because 95% of players aren't the top 5%.", "marf.", "Very good game, has good Mechanics, easy to get use to, affordable when u want, mm is easy and wm is even more easy , i rate this game a 9/10 u should buy it, it dosnt hurt to try another game other than fortnite :)\n\n- - -[Audience] - - -\n\u2610 Your Mom probably would enjoy this\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Everyone\n\u2611 Everyone except kids\n\u2611 Casual players\n\u2611 Pro players\n\u2611 People who plan to take one game and make it their life\n\n- - - [graphics] - - -\n\n\u2610 I want to poor bleach in my eyes\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\u2610 Bad, but playable.\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\n---[price]---\n\u2611 Free\n\u2610 Buy now\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2610 Wait for sale\n\u2610 Maybe if you have some spare money left\n\u2610 Do not buy it\n\u2610 Do not throw money into a trash can\n\n- - - [specs] - - -\n\n\u2611 Minimum\n\u2610 Medium\n\u2610 High end\n\u2610 NASA computer\n\n- - - [skill] - - -\n\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Average (Depends on the difficulty set)\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Only the best of the best can complete this game\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2611 Nothing\n\u2611 Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 A bit grindy...sometimes\n\u2610 Practically a full time job\n\n- - - [gameplay] - - -\n\n\u2611 Only gameplay, doesn't include a story.\n\u2610 There is a story, but most of the game is focused on gameplay.\n\u2610 Better than nothing I suppose...\n\u2610 Average.\n\u2610 Decent.\n\u2610 Amazing!\n\u2610 It\u2018ll replace your life\n\n- - - [bugs] - - -\n\n\u2610 Game itself is one big BUG\n\u2610 Lot of bugs (Can get annoying)\n\u2611 Few Bugs\n\u2610 You can use them for speedrun\n\u2610 Nothing (I've seen)\n\n---[time]---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of tea\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Not too short\n\u2611 Depends on you\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 Very Long\n\u2611 Endless\n\n- - - [length] - - -\n\u2610 One long, tedious grind\n\u2610 Better than mobile\n\u2610 Fun at first, but gets old quick\n\u2610 Consistently fun\n\u2611 Can't stop playing, even though I should be finished.", "good game", "apart fomr the constant russians telling me to f*** my mum its a great game", "i am black", "best game ngl so much better than valorant", "Give me knife or i will kill you all :)", "Great matchmaking", "good game", "It's Good.\n", "got better", "veyr tresh :(", "BEST OF THE BEST", "+ rep good game", "Nice Game", " so hhalalal mode so mcuh fun!", "Amazing game, as usual!", "Pls no", "liked it", "There are a lot of cheaters but still ok", "dancers", "nice game \ud83d\udc9c", "Very good BUM BUM nice skin BAM BAM yes", "Best game ever!!!", "nice game", "I got shot", "This game took all my money...", "Awesome if cheaters going off 4 just a hour", "FUN game try it out just try it out its a super fun game", "Love it, been playing for a looooong time", "pretty cool game", "cool game\n", "Game is very nice its my second time playing it <3", "this game good", "str8 banger bro", "every time i play comp, i get kicked while iam doing good, last game i played it was 15-7 til us and they kicked me, nice game", "bad game", "Good Game", "good game", "VERY COOL GAME LOTS OF CHEATERS AND HEAD ACHES :)))", "This is very good game, highly recommend this game", "Love & Hate relationship", "\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u043f", "maistuu salami", "NICE GAME \nMUST PLAY ONCE IN YOUR LIFETIME", "good game", "shit gamer", "they should make the knife droppable", "garbage", "very fun", "The best game", "this is doo doo game for little kid", "Good game but a lot of toxic russians :(.", "fun fun fun", "ITS OK", "sicko", "cs:go can ever be a fun game :3\n", "gud game", "nice game,but still best 1.6 <3\n", "good game", "dawdawdadad", "Really great game.

It does not feel like the exception; it feels like the rule. Indeed, some days I haven't even had a clean match based on how many of my prior matches have a convicted cheater in them.

However, a majority of that time spent has been in casual matches due to only being able to solo queue). As for the game itself it can be good fun just to dive straight into a server and get the satisfaction of tapping heads.\n\nHowever for both casual and competitive matches [i]it really is[/i] no place for anyone wanting to queue solo and, of course, it can be the same for other multiplayer games but not as bad as this game; that's for sure. As a prime example you most definitely and unfortunately will come across a player that will cheat as well as players that may not understand English which makes it a worse experience since communication is [b]key[/b] to truly work together as a team.\n\nIn addition to that, you may also either be matched up with players who are unfriendly and not showing good sportsmanship which only encourages negative mentality and stops you from fully focusing on the match.\n\nAlso I would like to mention, and I'm sure many people know this already, that this game also contains quite a few bugs such as not being able to hit a player whilst standing still and / or crouching aiming at their head.

Relative to modern shooters it is worse in about every aspect imaginable. 50% of the time no matter what your trust factor is you will get put in a game with a cheater, and you can't do anything but get an ass whooping for 40 minutes or abandon the match and get a competitive ban. What's worse is the fact that they have removed bots from competitive for LITERALLY no reason so an enemy team has no insentive to kick their cheater. That is, if they could even kick them. Not even an hour ago I was against a queue where 3 people were partied together blatantly walling and bhop scripting on mirage. My entire team played the game dead silent not even shooting at people most of the time. This game has been on a downwards slope for years and now genuinely makes me want to go back to source and/or 1.6. If you want to play this game competitively then you have to do it through a 3rd party org who will most likely pay for you to have a reasonable experience. At that point you may be thinking, this game should be alright now right? Wrong. High level faceit is mostly full of closet cheaters who play the game to win tournament money. This game is so fucking far into the abyss that I don't even see how Valve can fix it. They finally made it where you have to pay for prime now. That must be a step in the right direction right? Sure, but the hundreds of thousands of free accounts who got to level 21 using cheats got grandfathered in. I really hope Valve can salvage this game because they are doing so little over so long (and boy do I mean so so so long).\n\nanyways 9/10 this game is fun", "played it a bit, it's ok", "Well after many hours in the game,\nHave to say that the game is fun but gives you Mental illnesses.\nCan't stop to play i am an ADDICT.\nEvery Sunday i am going to a group therapy.\nThank you", "Well structured, competitive and fun game. However, CSGO environment has became toxic with the never ending waves of hackers. Don't bother to spend money in this game or consider buying premium since CSGO has no permanent solution towards the hackers so the game is very unfair and no fun when there's hackers.", "Game is overall a great game depending on many factors, which i will go over in this review. To start with this isn't a game you can just jump into and be #1, it takes a lot of practice, time and commitment. Overall i've played this game for 2,400+ hours combined between my multiple accounts. I have personally loved this game for what it has to offer and have always been a fan of the game-mode and the genre of the game.\n\nI will be going over the positives and negatives in this review as well as summing it up at the end with my overall thoughts and opinions. I will admit this game isn't for the light hearted, as the community is a fairly toxic but also pleasant community. I have made many friends but also dealt with a lot of childish players within this game. You will be able to make friends quite easily and play with them constantly making it easier to rank up as your playing with people you can communicate with rather then random people.\n\nThere are a few key points to this game that make it amazing those are, team work, communication, skill, knowledge and memory. Team work is a vital part of this game and is what makes it amazing, it's a lot harder to win when you aren't playing as a team, any great team requires great communication, communication is an important part, as well as knowing what to call and when to call it. This game requires some skill, at the higher levels a lot more skill. This doesn't necessarily mean you need to be the best, as there are ranks in competitive for a reason to assign you to people in similar ranks, although there are smurfs and cheaters as with any competitive game. Knowledge and memory go together, can't have one without the other in this game, you need to be knowledgeable in how to peek, where to peek, how to peek together and more similar situations, to top it off you also need good memory in where to smoke, how to smoke certain positions, as well as flashbangs and other utilities.\n\nIn saying that, that is mainly only the competitive side of this game, there are many other amazing features offered in this game, those being community servers, arms races, demolition, casual and other gamemodes. This game has a lot to offer, in particular one of my favourite parts of this game is the community servers, you have surf servers, and game servers, making it a game for everyone.\n\nIf you are feeling like taking your gaming to the next level i would highly recommend this game, there are many leagues to join i.e FaceIT and similar. There is also the pro scene which many make it to in different divisions, this allows for the best of the best to play for cash and other rewards.\n\nThis game has no real pay to win features besides when the game requires you to now pay for prime, which is totally worth it! There are skins, but those do not have any advantage besides player models which can make it harder to see the person which is playing.\n\nNow i will give you all a lovely bullet point list of what this has to offer quickly ran down with negatives and positives below:\n\nThe Negatives:\n1) The Community - This will be featured in both areas, as it is a downfall and a positive, the community can be quite toxic but also quite welcoming.\n2) Learning Curve - There is a learning curve for this game, so don't expect to jump in and be rambo.\n3) The Cheaters - This comes with any game, but in this game there is a chance you will run into cheaters quite frequently.\n\nThe Positives:\n1) Amazing Game - This game is always going to be a top game and very popular at that.\n2) Requires Co-operation - This game i personally enjoy for the fact it requires the team to work as a team.\n3) Fun Combat - The guns have recoil patterns to learn, getting a good one tap is quite fun. Overall combat is a great aspect of this game.\n4) Top Selling Game - This game is a top selling game for a reason, allowing all sorts of players from all over to play an amazing FPS.\n\nThats the good and bad quickly summed up, i will be updating this review as time goes on. I hope you all enjoyed and if you have any questions feel free to leave them below and I will get to you as soon as i can. If you are looking for a game to have some fun then this is the game for you, aslong as you know what your in for.

The game has a serious and ongoing hacker and smurfing problem, and even if someone isn't cheating, it's hard to play against anyone good without seriously questioning if they are using some kind of third party cheat. The game is fun to play about half of the time.\n\nI am definitely no where near top skill in this game, I only place GN, but it's hard to play competitively or even just for fun at all anymore when you always have to live in fear of someone cheating the system to ruin your day. While obviously not every match you place into is going to have a cheater or a smurf, after playing for long such matches appear enough to tarnish the whole experience.\n\nI still won't recommend you play Valorant though.", "I started playing CSGO a while back and basically play war games to get the yearly badge.  I'm not the greatest and I know there are players better than me, but when you have a player running up the stairs and they shoot you while their back is to you and kill you, something is going on.  Or you have another player who takes on 3 players of the enemy team and mows them down like nothing and continues playing.  Also, the AFKers who are continually dragged from one match to another (and no, they aren't turning in circles, they are just standing there) and their friends won't kick them, something needs to be done about this.\n\nBut the worse thing is the people with a high ping (over 150 or more) when the rest of the players are at 15-40 ping.  Why are these people even allowed to join these matches.  Also, with all the thousands of people in this game, why do I continually get placed with the same 7-10 players where I can't get kills because either my teammates or the other team are getting 16 - 22 headshots or more?  I left the game once and didn't play for six months, but I'm just after the badge, but finding it may not be worth it as Valve's anti-cheat isn't very effective.", "many cheaters", "The game is toxic and has to many cheaters.

I got the game for my son because he wanted to play it with his friends and I think playing this game with his friends made them closer. He gets out of the house a lot too with his friends and only spends some of his free time playing video games. I approve of this game because he seems to enjoy it and it has no negative effect on him or any of the kids that I know that play it too and it\u2019s all about strategy and competition and has

Please tell me how I can accomplish achievements: 1) Veteran of map Aztec, 2) Veteran of map Dust , 3) Veteran of map Shorttrain, 4) This Glass World, 5) Sniper, 6) Tourist when you removed these 3 maps, thereby making these achievements unworkable. I hope to hear an adequate answer from you, since I really do not understand what the problem is: you have deleted maps, delete achievements, do not want to delete achievements, add maps back. + The game is actively supported by developers, updates are coming out. I encounter such a problem for the first time and for my understanding it is nonsense when game developers remove game content so plus tied to achievements. I perform all games on 100% ONLY HONESTLY and how can I perform these achievements when they are broken?\n\nAnswer from Steam support:\n\nWe are currently aware that certain achievements are no longer able to be obtained due to the maps being removed from the game. Unfortunately, we cannot provide a workaround for obtaining these achievements but I have forwarded your concerns on this matter onto the CS:GO team so they're aware. \n\nPlease let us know if you have any other questions or issues that we may assist you with.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nThe developer has done nothing since 2017 when they have broken these 6 achievement. Maybe it is new fashion, break something that is working good. I want you to know only one thing if you ignore the quality of your project remember that this is the way to nowhere. I hope that there is at least 1 person in your development team who understands and will correct this problem.\n\nAbout the game:\n\nThe very good game. Didn't meet any bugs. The game engine gives us the very good picture.

AWP seems very OP...\n\nHello folks, just got the game today from the steam sale. Not completely new to CS, I've owned CSS for a few years now but only because it was on sale bundled with gmod which is what I was really after, though still a fun game that I'd play a few times a month.\n\nOnce thing I've noticed about almost every CSS server I've played on is every sniper but the Scout is banned, for good reason I thought since when I went into servers where they weren't banned no one was using anything but these weapons (mostly the AWP). In a game about making twitch precision headshots, the AWP seems to break it since you don't need to be very precise with it at all.\n\nMy experience with the AWP in CSS is actually why I've put off buying CS GO for so long. I knew that you get into most games through matchmaking meaning you have to deal with AWPS, and I feared most games would be reduced to everyone using AWPS vs everyone using AWPS, with people not using AWPS gettings shit on unless they're miles better than the enemy team. I ended up buying the game anyway today though since it's cheap and very popular.\n\nTurns out my fears were completely justified. The AWP completely breaks the game. All skill goes out the window once you can afford an AWP, just take a seat and anyone who approaches you instantly dies. Honestly I'm really disappointing and I'm already starting to regret this purchase, since I have a lot more fun in CSS where there are mostly no AWPS.\n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way about this weapon? I feel like the game would be so much better off without it. This one weapon is so game breaking that most CSS servers ban it, and this single weapon alone being legal has discouraged me from buying this entire game. I'm sure at the top 5% of play AWPS are balanced and natural part of the game... and CS elitists are going to have a field day with my \"noobish\" complaints, but honestly I don't give a shit :\\ because 95% of players aren't the top 5%.", "marf.", "Very good game, has good Mechanics, easy to get use to, affordable when u want, mm is easy and wm is even more easy , i rate this game a 9/10 u should buy it, it dosnt hurt to try another game other than fortnite :)\n\n- - -[Audience] - - -\n\u2610 Your Mom probably would enjoy this\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Everyone\n\u2611 Everyone except kids\n\u2611 Casual players\n\u2611 Pro players\n\u2611 People who plan to take one game and make it their life\n\n- - - [graphics] - - -\n\n\u2610 I want to poor bleach in my eyes\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\u2610 Bad, but playable.\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\n---[price]---\n\u2611 Free\n\u2610 Buy now\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2610 Wait for sale\n\u2610 Maybe if you have some spare money left\n\u2610 Do not buy it\n\u2610 Do not throw money into a trash can\n\n- - - [specs] - - -\n\n\u2611 Minimum\n\u2610 Medium\n\u2610 High end\n\u2610 NASA computer\n\n- - - [skill] - - -\n\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Average (Depends on the difficulty set)\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Only the best of the best can complete this game\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2611 Nothing\n\u2611 Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 A bit grindy...sometimes\n\u2610 Practically a full time job\n\n- - - [gameplay] - - -\n\n\u2611 Only gameplay, doesn't include a story.\n\u2610 There is a story, but most of the game is focused on gameplay.\n\u2610 Better than nothing I suppose...\n\u2610 Average.\n\u2610 Decent.\n\u2610 Amazing!\n\u2610 It\u2018ll replace your life\n\n- - - [bugs] - - -\n\n\u2610 Game itself is one big BUG\n\u2610 Lot of bugs (Can get annoying)\n\u2611 Few Bugs\n\u2610 You can use them for speedrun\n\u2610 Nothing (I've seen)\n\n---[time]---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of tea\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Not too short\n\u2611 Depends on you\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 Very Long\n\u2611 Endless\n\n- - - [length] - - -\n\u2610 One long, tedious grind\n\u2610 Better than mobile\n\u2610 Fun at first, but gets old quick\n\u2610 Consistently fun\n\u2611 Can't stop playing, even though I should be finished.", "good game", "apart fomr the constant russians telling me to f*** my mum its a great game", "i am black", "best game ngl so much better than valorant", "Give me knife or i will kill you all :)", "Great matchmaking", "good game", "It's Good.\n", "got better", "veyr tresh :(", "BEST OF THE BEST", "+ rep good game", "Nice Game", " so hhalalal mode so mcuh fun!", "Amazing game, as usual!", "Pls no", "liked it", "There are a lot of cheaters but still ok", "dancers", "nice game \ud83d\udc9c", "Very good BUM BUM nice skin BAM BAM yes", "Best game ever!!!", "nice game", "I got shot", "This game took all my money...", "Awesome if cheaters going off 4 just a hour", "FUN game try it out just try it out its a super fun game", "Love it, been playing for a looooong time", "pretty cool game", "cool game\n", "Game is very nice its my second time playing it <3", "this game good", "str8 banger bro", "every time i play comp, i get kicked while iam doing good, last game i played it was 15-7 til us and they kicked me, nice game", "bad game", "Good Game", "good game", "VERY COOL GAME LOTS OF CHEATERS AND HEAD ACHES :)))", "This is very good game, highly recommend this game", "Love & Hate relationship", "\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u043f", "maistuu salami", "NICE GAME \nMUST PLAY ONCE IN YOUR LIFETIME", "good game", "shit gamer", "they should make the knife droppable", "garbage", "very fun", "The best game", "this is doo doo game for little kid", "Good game but a lot of toxic russians :(.", "fun fun fun", "ITS OK", "sicko", "cs:go can ever be a fun game :3\n", "gud game", "nice game,but still best 1.6 <3\n", "good game", "dawdawdadad", "Really great game.

It does not feel like the exception; it feels like the rule. Indeed, some days I haven't even had a clean match based on how many of my prior matches have a convicted cheater in them.

However, a majority of that time spent has been in casual matches due to only being able to solo queue). As for the game itself it can be good fun just to dive straight into a server and get the satisfaction of tapping heads.\n\nHowever for both casual and competitive matches [i]it really is[/i] no place for anyone wanting to queue solo and, of course, it can be the same for other multiplayer games but not as bad as this game; that's for sure. As a prime example you most definitely and unfortunately will come across a player that will cheat as well as players that may not understand English which makes it a worse experience since communication is [b]key[/b] to truly work together as a team.\n\nIn addition to that, you may also either be matched up with players who are unfriendly and not showing good sportsmanship which only encourages negative mentality and stops you from fully focusing on the match.\n\nAlso I would like to mention, and I'm sure many people know this already, that this game also contains quite a few bugs such as not being able to hit a player whilst standing still and / or crouching aiming at their head.

Relative to modern shooters it is worse in about every aspect imaginable. 50% of the time no matter what your trust factor is you will get put in a game with a cheater, and you can't do anything but get an ass whooping for 40 minutes or abandon the match and get a competitive ban. What's worse is the fact that they have removed bots from competitive for LITERALLY no reason so an enemy team has no insentive to kick their cheater. That is, if they could even kick them. Not even an hour ago I was against a queue where 3 people were partied together blatantly walling and bhop scripting on mirage. My entire team played the game dead silent not even shooting at people most of the time. This game has been on a downwards slope for years and now genuinely makes me want to go back to source and/or 1.6. If you want to play this game competitively then you have to do it through a 3rd party org who will most likely pay for you to have a reasonable experience. At that point you may be thinking, this game should be alright now right? Wrong. High level faceit is mostly full of closet cheaters who play the game to win tournament money. This game is so fucking far into the abyss that I don't even see how Valve can fix it. They finally made it where you have to pay for prime now. That must be a step in the right direction right? Sure, but the hundreds of thousands of free accounts who got to level 21 using cheats got grandfathered in. I really hope Valve can salvage this game because they are doing so little over so long (and boy do I mean so so so long).\n\nanyways 9/10 this game is fun", "played it a bit, it's ok", "Well after many hours in the game,\nHave to say that the game is fun but gives you Mental illnesses.\nCan't stop to play i am an ADDICT.\nEvery Sunday i am going to a group therapy.\nThank you", "Well structured, competitive and fun game. However, CSGO environment has became toxic with the never ending waves of hackers. Don't bother to spend money in this game or consider buying premium since CSGO has no permanent solution towards the hackers so the game is very unfair and no fun when there's hackers.", "Game is overall a great game depending on many factors, which i will go over in this review. To start with this isn't a game you can just jump into and be #1, it takes a lot of practice, time and commitment. Overall i've played this game for 2,400+ hours combined between my multiple accounts. I have personally loved this game for what it has to offer and have always been a fan of the game-mode and the genre of the game.\n\nI will be going over the positives and negatives in this review as well as summing it up at the end with my overall thoughts and opinions. I will admit this game isn't for the light hearted, as the community is a fairly toxic but also pleasant community. I have made many friends but also dealt with a lot of childish players within this game. You will be able to make friends quite easily and play with them constantly making it easier to rank up as your playing with people you can communicate with rather then random people.\n\nThere are a few key points to this game that make it amazing those are, team work, communication, skill, knowledge and memory. Team work is a vital part of this game and is what makes it amazing, it's a lot harder to win when you aren't playing as a team, any great team requires great communication, communication is an important part, as well as knowing what to call and when to call it. This game requires some skill, at the higher levels a lot more skill. This doesn't necessarily mean you need to be the best, as there are ranks in competitive for a reason to assign you to people in similar ranks, although there are smurfs and cheaters as with any competitive game. Knowledge and memory go together, can't have one without the other in this game, you need to be knowledgeable in how to peek, where to peek, how to peek together and more similar situations, to top it off you also need good memory in where to smoke, how to smoke certain positions, as well as flashbangs and other utilities.\n\nIn saying that, that is mainly only the competitive side of this game, there are many other amazing features offered in this game, those being community servers, arms races, demolition, casual and other gamemodes. This game has a lot to offer, in particular one of my favourite parts of this game is the community servers, you have surf servers, and game servers, making it a game for everyone.\n\nIf you are feeling like taking your gaming to the next level i would highly recommend this game, there are many leagues to join i.e FaceIT and similar. There is also the pro scene which many make it to in different divisions, this allows for the best of the best to play for cash and other rewards.\n\nThis game has no real pay to win features besides when the game requires you to now pay for prime, which is totally worth it! There are skins, but those do not have any advantage besides player models which can make it harder to see the person which is playing.\n\nNow i will give you all a lovely bullet point list of what this has to offer quickly ran down with negatives and positives below:\n\nThe Negatives:\n1) The Community - This will be featured in both areas, as it is a downfall and a positive, the community can be quite toxic but also quite welcoming.\n2) Learning Curve - There is a learning curve for this game, so don't expect to jump in and be rambo.\n3) The Cheaters - This comes with any game, but in this game there is a chance you will run into cheaters quite frequently.\n\nThe Positives:\n1) Amazing Game - This game is always going to be a top game and very popular at that.\n2) Requires Co-operation - This game i personally enjoy for the fact it requires the team to work as a team.\n3) Fun Combat - The guns have recoil patterns to learn, getting a good one tap is quite fun. Overall combat is a great aspect of this game.\n4) Top Selling Game - This game is a top selling game for a reason, allowing all sorts of players from all over to play an amazing FPS.\n\nThats the good and bad quickly summed up, i will be updating this review as time goes on. I hope you all enjoyed and if you have any questions feel free to leave them below and I will get to you as soon as i can. If you are looking for a game to have some fun then this is the game for you, aslong as you know what your in for.

The game has a serious and ongoing hacker and smurfing problem, and even if someone isn't cheating, it's hard to play against anyone good without seriously questioning if they are using some kind of third party cheat. The game is fun to play about half of the time.\n\nI am definitely no where near top skill in this game, I only place GN, but it's hard to play competitively or even just for fun at all anymore when you always have to live in fear of someone cheating the system to ruin your day. While obviously not every match you place into is going to have a cheater or a smurf, after playing for long such matches appear enough to tarnish the whole experience.\n\nI still won't recommend you play Valorant though.", "I started playing CSGO a while back and basically play war games to get the yearly badge.  I'm not the greatest and I know there are players better than me, but when you have a player running up the stairs and they shoot you while their back is to you and kill you, something is going on.  Or you have another player who takes on 3 players of the enemy team and mows them down like nothing and continues playing.  Also, the AFKers who are continually dragged from one match to another (and no, they aren't turning in circles, they are just standing there) and their friends won't kick them, something needs to be done about this.\n\nBut the worse thing is the people with a high ping (over 150 or more) when the rest of the players are at 15-40 ping.  Why are these people even allowed to join these matches.  Also, with all the thousands of people in this game, why do I continually get placed with the same 7-10 players where I can't get kills because either my teammates or the other team are getting 16 - 22 headshots or more?  I left the game once and didn't play for six months, but I'm just after the badge, but finding it may not be worth it as Valve's anti-cheat isn't very effective.", "many cheaters", "The game is toxic and has to many cheaters.

I got the game for my son because he wanted to play it with his friends and I think playing this game with his friends made them closer. He gets out of the house a lot too with his friends and only spends some of his free time playing video games. I approve of this game because he seems to enjoy it and it has no negative effect on him or any of the kids that I know that play it too and it\u2019s all about strategy and competition and has

Please tell me how I can accomplish achievements: 1) Veteran of map Aztec, 2) Veteran of map Dust , 3) Veteran of map Shorttrain, 4) This Glass World, 5) Sniper, 6) Tourist when you removed these 3 maps, thereby making these achievements unworkable. I hope to hear an adequate answer from you, since I really do not understand what the problem is: you have deleted maps, delete achievements, do not want to delete achievements, add maps back. + The game is actively supported by developers, updates are coming out. I encounter such a problem for the first time and for my understanding it is nonsense when game developers remove game content so plus tied to achievements. I perform all games on 100% ONLY HONESTLY and how can I perform these achievements when they are broken?\n\nAnswer from Steam support:\n\nWe are currently aware that certain achievements are no longer able to be obtained due to the maps being removed from the game. Unfortunately, we cannot provide a workaround for obtaining these achievements but I have forwarded your concerns on this matter onto the CS:GO team so they're aware. \n\nPlease let us know if you have any other questions or issues that we may assist you with.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nThe developer has done nothing since 2017 when they have broken these 6 achievement. Maybe it is new fashion, break something that is working good. I want you to know only one thing if you ignore the quality of your project remember that this is the way to nowhere. I hope that there is at least 1 person in your development team who understands and will correct this problem.\n\nAbout the game:\n\nThe very good game. Didn't meet any bugs. The game engine gives us the very good picture.

AWP seems very OP...\n\nHello folks, just got the game today from the steam sale. Not completely new to CS, I've owned CSS for a few years now but only because it was on sale bundled with gmod which is what I was really after, though still a fun game that I'd play a few times a month.\n\nOnce thing I've noticed about almost every CSS server I've played on is every sniper but the Scout is banned, for good reason I thought since when I went into servers where they weren't banned no one was using anything but these weapons (mostly the AWP). In a game about making twitch precision headshots, the AWP seems to break it since you don't need to be very precise with it at all.\n\nMy experience with the AWP in CSS is actually why I've put off buying CS GO for so long. I knew that you get into most games through matchmaking meaning you have to deal with AWPS, and I feared most games would be reduced to everyone using AWPS vs everyone using AWPS, with people not using AWPS gettings shit on unless they're miles better than the enemy team. I ended up buying the game anyway today though since it's cheap and very popular.\n\nTurns out my fears were completely justified. The AWP completely breaks the game. All skill goes out the window once you can afford an AWP, just take a seat and anyone who approaches you instantly dies. Honestly I'm really disappointing and I'm already starting to regret this purchase, since I have a lot more fun in CSS where there are mostly no AWPS.\n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way about this weapon? I feel like the game would be so much better off without it. This one weapon is so game breaking that most CSS servers ban it, and this single weapon alone being legal has discouraged me from buying this entire game. I'm sure at the top 5% of play AWPS are balanced and natural part of the game... and CS elitists are going to have a field day with my \"noobish\" complaints, but honestly I don't give a shit :\\ because 95% of players aren't the top 5%.", "marf.", "Very good game, has good Mechanics, easy to get use to, affordable when u want, mm is easy and wm is even more easy , i rate this game a 9/10 u should buy it, it dosnt hurt to try another game other than fortnite :)\n\n- - -[Audience] - - -\n\u2610 Your Mom probably would enjoy this\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Everyone\n\u2611 Everyone except kids\n\u2611 Casual players\n\u2611 Pro players\n\u2611 People who plan to take one game and make it their life\n\n- - - [graphics] - - -\n\n\u2610 I want to poor bleach in my eyes\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\u2610 Bad, but playable.\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\n---[price]---\n\u2611 Free\n\u2610 Buy now\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2610 Wait for sale\n\u2610 Maybe if you have some spare money left\n\u2610 Do not buy it\n\u2610 Do not throw money into a trash can\n\n- - - [specs] - - -\n\n\u2611 Minimum\n\u2610 Medium\n\u2610 High end\n\u2610 NASA computer\n\n- - - [skill] - - -\n\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Average (Depends on the difficulty set)\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Only the best of the best can complete this game\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2611 Nothing\n\u2611 Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 A bit grindy...sometimes\n\u2610 Practically a full time job\n\n- - - [gameplay] - - -\n\n\u2611 Only gameplay, doesn't include a story.\n\u2610 There is a story, but most of the game is focused on gameplay.\n\u2610 Better than nothing I suppose...\n\u2610 Average.\n\u2610 Decent.\n\u2610 Amazing!\n\u2610 It\u2018ll replace your life\n\n- - - [bugs] - - -\n\n\u2610 Game itself is one big BUG\n\u2610 Lot of bugs (Can get annoying)\n\u2611 Few Bugs\n\u2610 You can use them for speedrun\n\u2610 Nothing (I've seen)\n\n---[time]---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of tea\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Not too short\n\u2611 Depends on you\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 Very Long\n\u2611 Endless\n\n- - - [length] - - -\n\u2610 One long, tedious grind\n\u2610 Better than mobile\n\u2610 Fun at first, but gets old quick\n\u2610 Consistently fun\n\u2611 Can't stop playing, even though I should be finished.", "good game", "apart fomr the constant russians telling me to f*** my mum its a great game", "i am black", "best game ngl so much better than valorant", "Give me knife or i will kill you all :)", "Great matchmaking", "good game", "It's Good.\n", "got better", "veyr tresh :(", "BEST OF THE BEST", "+ rep good game", "Nice Game", " so hhalalal mode so mcuh fun!", "Amazing game, as usual!", "Pls no", "liked it", "There are a lot of cheaters but still ok", "dancers", "nice game \ud83d\udc9c", "Very good BUM BUM nice skin BAM BAM yes", "Best game ever!!!", "nice game", "I got shot", "This game took all my money...", "Awesome if cheaters going off 4 just a hour", "FUN game try it out just try it out its a super fun game", "Love it, been playing for a looooong time", "pretty cool game", "cool game\n", "Game is very nice its my second time playing it <3", "this game good", "str8 banger bro", "every time i play comp, i get kicked while iam doing good, last game i played it was 15-7 til us and they kicked me, nice game", "bad game", "Good Game", "good game", "VERY COOL GAME LOTS OF CHEATERS AND HEAD ACHES :)))", "This is very good game, highly recommend this game", "Love & Hate relationship", "\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u043f", "maistuu salami", "NICE GAME \nMUST PLAY ONCE IN YOUR LIFETIME", "good game", "shit gamer", "they should make the knife droppable", "garbage", "very fun", "The best game", "this is doo doo game for little kid", "Good game but a lot of toxic russians :(.", "fun fun fun", "ITS OK", "sicko", "cs:go can ever be a fun game :3\n", "gud game", "nice game,but still best 1.6 <3\n", "good game", "dawdawdadad", "Really great game.

It does not feel like the exception; it feels like the rule. Indeed, some days I haven't even had a clean match based on how many of my prior matches have a convicted cheater in them.

However, a majority of that time spent has been in casual matches due to only being able to solo queue). As for the game itself it can be good fun just to dive straight into a server and get the satisfaction of tapping heads.\n\nHowever for both casual and competitive matches [i]it really is[/i] no place for anyone wanting to queue solo and, of course, it can be the same for other multiplayer games but not as bad as this game; that's for sure. As a prime example you most definitely and unfortunately will come across a player that will cheat as well as players that may not understand English which makes it a worse experience since communication is [b]key[/b] to truly work together as a team.\n\nIn addition to that, you may also either be matched up with players who are unfriendly and not showing good sportsmanship which only encourages negative mentality and stops you from fully focusing on the match.\n\nAlso I would like to mention, and I'm sure many people know this already, that this game also contains quite a few bugs such as not being able to hit a player whilst standing still and / or crouching aiming at their head.

Relative to modern shooters it is worse in about every aspect imaginable. 50% of the time no matter what your trust factor is you will get put in a game with a cheater, and you can't do anything but get an ass whooping for 40 minutes or abandon the match and get a competitive ban. What's worse is the fact that they have removed bots from competitive for LITERALLY no reason so an enemy team has no insentive to kick their cheater. That is, if they could even kick them. Not even an hour ago I was against a queue where 3 people were partied together blatantly walling and bhop scripting on mirage. My entire team played the game dead silent not even shooting at people most of the time. This game has been on a downwards slope for years and now genuinely makes me want to go back to source and/or 1.6. If you want to play this game competitively then you have to do it through a 3rd party org who will most likely pay for you to have a reasonable experience. At that point you may be thinking, this game should be alright now right? Wrong. High level faceit is mostly full of closet cheaters who play the game to win tournament money. This game is so fucking far into the abyss that I don't even see how Valve can fix it. They finally made it where you have to pay for prime now. That must be a step in the right direction right? Sure, but the hundreds of thousands of free accounts who got to level 21 using cheats got grandfathered in. I really hope Valve can salvage this game because they are doing so little over so long (and boy do I mean so so so long).\n\nanyways 9/10 this game is fun", "played it a bit, it's ok", "Well after many hours in the game,\nHave to say that the game is fun but gives you Mental illnesses.\nCan't stop to play i am an ADDICT.\nEvery Sunday i am going to a group therapy.\nThank you", "Well structured, competitive and fun game. However, CSGO environment has became toxic with the never ending waves of hackers. Don't bother to spend money in this game or consider buying premium since CSGO has no permanent solution towards the hackers so the game is very unfair and no fun when there's hackers.", "Game is overall a great game depending on many factors, which i will go over in this review. To start with this isn't a game you can just jump into and be #1, it takes a lot of practice, time and commitment. Overall i've played this game for 2,400+ hours combined between my multiple accounts. I have personally loved this game for what it has to offer and have always been a fan of the game-mode and the genre of the game.\n\nI will be going over the positives and negatives in this review as well as summing it up at the end with my overall thoughts and opinions. I will admit this game isn't for the light hearted, as the community is a fairly toxic but also pleasant community. I have made many friends but also dealt with a lot of childish players within this game. You will be able to make friends quite easily and play with them constantly making it easier to rank up as your playing with people you can communicate with rather then random people.\n\nThere are a few key points to this game that make it amazing those are, team work, communication, skill, knowledge and memory. Team work is a vital part of this game and is what makes it amazing, it's a lot harder to win when you aren't playing as a team, any great team requires great communication, communication is an important part, as well as knowing what to call and when to call it. This game requires some skill, at the higher levels a lot more skill. This doesn't necessarily mean you need to be the best, as there are ranks in competitive for a reason to assign you to people in similar ranks, although there are smurfs and cheaters as with any competitive game. Knowledge and memory go together, can't have one without the other in this game, you need to be knowledgeable in how to peek, where to peek, how to peek together and more similar situations, to top it off you also need good memory in where to smoke, how to smoke certain positions, as well as flashbangs and other utilities.\n\nIn saying that, that is mainly only the competitive side of this game, there are many other amazing features offered in this game, those being community servers, arms races, demolition, casual and other gamemodes. This game has a lot to offer, in particular one of my favourite parts of this game is the community servers, you have surf servers, and game servers, making it a game for everyone.\n\nIf you are feeling like taking your gaming to the next level i would highly recommend this game, there are many leagues to join i.e FaceIT and similar. There is also the pro scene which many make it to in different divisions, this allows for the best of the best to play for cash and other rewards.\n\nThis game has no real pay to win features besides when the game requires you to now pay for prime, which is totally worth it! There are skins, but those do not have any advantage besides player models which can make it harder to see the person which is playing.\n\nNow i will give you all a lovely bullet point list of what this has to offer quickly ran down with negatives and positives below:\n\nThe Negatives:\n1) The Community - This will be featured in both areas, as it is a downfall and a positive, the community can be quite toxic but also quite welcoming.\n2) Learning Curve - There is a learning curve for this game, so don't expect to jump in and be rambo.\n3) The Cheaters - This comes with any game, but in this game there is a chance you will run into cheaters quite frequently.\n\nThe Positives:\n1) Amazing Game - This game is always going to be a top game and very popular at that.\n2) Requires Co-operation - This game i personally enjoy for the fact it requires the team to work as a team.\n3) Fun Combat - The guns have recoil patterns to learn, getting a good one tap is quite fun. Overall combat is a great aspect of this game.\n4) Top Selling Game - This game is a top selling game for a reason, allowing all sorts of players from all over to play an amazing FPS.\n\nThats the good and bad quickly summed up, i will be updating this review as time goes on. I hope you all enjoyed and if you have any questions feel free to leave them below and I will get to you as soon as i can. If you are looking for a game to have some fun then this is the game for you, aslong as you know what your in for.

The game has a serious and ongoing hacker and smurfing problem, and even if someone isn't cheating, it's hard to play against anyone good without seriously questioning if they are using some kind of third party cheat. The game is fun to play about half of the time.\n\nI am definitely no where near top skill in this game, I only place GN, but it's hard to play competitively or even just for fun at all anymore when you always have to live in fear of someone cheating the system to ruin your day. While obviously not every match you place into is going to have a cheater or a smurf, after playing for long such matches appear enough to tarnish the whole experience.\n\nI still won't recommend you play Valorant though.", "I started playing CSGO a while back and basically play war games to get the yearly badge.  I'm not the greatest and I know there are players better than me, but when you have a player running up the stairs and they shoot you while their back is to you and kill you, something is going on.  Or you have another player who takes on 3 players of the enemy team and mows them down like nothing and continues playing.  Also, the AFKers who are continually dragged from one match to another (and no, they aren't turning in circles, they are just standing there) and their friends won't kick them, something needs to be done about this.\n\nBut the worse thing is the people with a high ping (over 150 or more) when the rest of the players are at 15-40 ping.  Why are these people even allowed to join these matches.  Also, with all the thousands of people in this game, why do I continually get placed with the same 7-10 players where I can't get kills because either my teammates or the other team are getting 16 - 22 headshots or more?  I left the game once and didn't play for six months, but I'm just after the badge, but finding it may not be worth it as Valve's anti-cheat isn't very effective.", "many cheaters", "The game is toxic and has to many cheaters.

I got the game for my son because he wanted to play it with his friends and I think playing this game with his friends made them closer. He gets out of the house a lot too with his friends and only spends some of his free time playing video games. I approve of this game because he seems to enjoy it and it has no negative effect on him or any of the kids that I know that play it too and it\u2019s all about strategy and competition and has

Please tell me how I can accomplish achievements: 1) Veteran of map Aztec, 2) Veteran of map Dust , 3) Veteran of map Shorttrain, 4) This Glass World, 5) Sniper, 6) Tourist when you removed these 3 maps, thereby making these achievements unworkable. I hope to hear an adequate answer from you, since I really do not understand what the problem is: you have deleted maps, delete achievements, do not want to delete achievements, add maps back. + The game is actively supported by developers, updates are coming out. I encounter such a problem for the first time and for my understanding it is nonsense when game developers remove game content so plus tied to achievements. I perform all games on 100% ONLY HONESTLY and how can I perform these achievements when they are broken?\n\nAnswer from Steam support:\n\nWe are currently aware that certain achievements are no longer able to be obtained due to the maps being removed from the game. Unfortunately, we cannot provide a workaround for obtaining these achievements but I have forwarded your concerns on this matter onto the CS:GO team so they're aware. \n\nPlease let us know if you have any other questions or issues that we may assist you with.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nThe developer has done nothing since 2017 when they have broken these 6 achievement. Maybe it is new fashion, break something that is working good. I want you to know only one thing if you ignore the quality of your project remember that this is the way to nowhere. I hope that there is at least 1 person in your development team who understands and will correct this problem.\n\nAbout the game:\n\nThe very good game. Didn't meet any bugs. The game engine gives us the very good picture.

AWP seems very OP...\n\nHello folks, just got the game today from the steam sale. Not completely new to CS, I've owned CSS for a few years now but only because it was on sale bundled with gmod which is what I was really after, though still a fun game that I'd play a few times a month.\n\nOnce thing I've noticed about almost every CSS server I've played on is every sniper but the Scout is banned, for good reason I thought since when I went into servers where they weren't banned no one was using anything but these weapons (mostly the AWP). In a game about making twitch precision headshots, the AWP seems to break it since you don't need to be very precise with it at all.\n\nMy experience with the AWP in CSS is actually why I've put off buying CS GO for so long. I knew that you get into most games through matchmaking meaning you have to deal with AWPS, and I feared most games would be reduced to everyone using AWPS vs everyone using AWPS, with people not using AWPS gettings shit on unless they're miles better than the enemy team. I ended up buying the game anyway today though since it's cheap and very popular.\n\nTurns out my fears were completely justified. The AWP completely breaks the game. All skill goes out the window once you can afford an AWP, just take a seat and anyone who approaches you instantly dies. Honestly I'm really disappointing and I'm already starting to regret this purchase, since I have a lot more fun in CSS where there are mostly no AWPS.\n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way about this weapon? I feel like the game would be so much better off without it. This one weapon is so game breaking that most CSS servers ban it, and this single weapon alone being legal has discouraged me from buying this entire game. I'm sure at the top 5% of play AWPS are balanced and natural part of the game... and CS elitists are going to have a field day with my \"noobish\" complaints, but honestly I don't give a shit :\\ because 95% of players aren't the top 5%.", "marf.", "Very good game, has good Mechanics, easy to get use to, affordable when u want, mm is easy and wm is even more easy , i rate this game a 9/10 u should buy it, it dosnt hurt to try another game other than fortnite :)\n\n- - -[Audience] - - -\n\u2610 Your Mom probably would enjoy this\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Everyone\n\u2611 Everyone except kids\n\u2611 Casual players\n\u2611 Pro players\n\u2611 People who plan to take one game and make it their life\n\n- - - [graphics] - - -\n\n\u2610 I want to poor bleach in my eyes\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\u2610 Bad, but playable.\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\n---[price]---\n\u2611 Free\n\u2610 Buy now\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2610 Wait for sale\n\u2610 Maybe if you have some spare money left\n\u2610 Do not buy it\n\u2610 Do not throw money into a trash can\n\n- - - [specs] - - -\n\n\u2611 Minimum\n\u2610 Medium\n\u2610 High end\n\u2610 NASA computer\n\n- - - [skill] - - -\n\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Average (Depends on the difficulty set)\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Only the best of the best can complete this game\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2611 Nothing\n\u2611 Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 A bit grindy...sometimes\n\u2610 Practically a full time job\n\n- - - [gameplay] - - -\n\n\u2611 Only gameplay, doesn't include a story.\n\u2610 There is a story, but most of the game is focused on gameplay.\n\u2610 Better than nothing I suppose...\n\u2610 Average.\n\u2610 Decent.\n\u2610 Amazing!\n\u2610 It\u2018ll replace your life\n\n- - - [bugs] - - -\n\n\u2610 Game itself is one big BUG\n\u2610 Lot of bugs (Can get annoying)\n\u2611 Few Bugs\n\u2610 You can use them for speedrun\n\u2610 Nothing (I've seen)\n\n---[time]---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of tea\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Not too short\n\u2611 Depends on you\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 Very Long\n\u2611 Endless\n\n- - - [length] - - -\n\u2610 One long, tedious grind\n\u2610 Better than mobile\n\u2610 Fun at first, but gets old quick\n\u2610 Consistently fun\n\u2611 Can't stop playing, even though I should be finished.", "good game", "apart fomr the constant russians telling me to f*** my mum its a great game", "i am black", "best game ngl so much better than valorant", "Give me knife or i will kill you all :)", "Great matchmaking", "good game", "It's Good.\n", "got better", "veyr tresh :(", "BEST OF THE BEST", "+ rep good game", "Nice Game", " so hhalalal mode so mcuh fun!", "Amazing game, as usual!", "Pls no", "liked it", "There are a lot of cheaters but still ok", "dancers", "nice game \ud83d\udc9c", "Very good BUM BUM nice skin BAM BAM yes", "Best game ever!!!", "nice game", "I got shot", "This game took all my money...", "Awesome if cheaters going off 4 just a hour", "FUN game try it out just try it out its a super fun game", "Love it, been playing for a looooong time", "pretty cool game", "cool game\n", "Game is very nice its my second time playing it <3", "this game good", "str8 banger bro", "every time i play comp, i get kicked while iam doing good, last game i played it was 15-7 til us and they kicked me, nice game", "bad game", "Good Game", "good game", "VERY COOL GAME LOTS OF CHEATERS AND HEAD ACHES :)))", "This is very good game, highly recommend this game", "Love & Hate relationship", "\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u043f", "maistuu salami", "NICE GAME \nMUST PLAY ONCE IN YOUR LIFETIME", "good game", "shit gamer", "they should make the knife droppable", "garbage", "very fun", "The best game", "this is doo doo game for little kid", "Good game but a lot of toxic russians :(.", "fun fun fun", "ITS OK", "sicko", "cs:go can ever be a fun game :3\n", "gud game", "nice game,but still best 1.6 <3\n", "good game", "dawdawdadad", "Really great game.

It does not feel like the exception; it feels like the rule. Indeed, some days I haven't even had a clean match based on how many of my prior matches have a convicted cheater in them.

However, a majority of that time spent has been in casual matches due to only being able to solo queue). As for the game itself it can be good fun just to dive straight into a server and get the satisfaction of tapping heads.\n\nHowever for both casual and competitive matches [i]it really is[/i] no place for anyone wanting to queue solo and, of course, it can be the same for other multiplayer games but not as bad as this game; that's for sure. As a prime example you most definitely and unfortunately will come across a player that will cheat as well as players that may not understand English which makes it a worse experience since communication is [b]key[/b] to truly work together as a team.\n\nIn addition to that, you may also either be matched up with players who are unfriendly and not showing good sportsmanship which only encourages negative mentality and stops you from fully focusing on the match.\n\nAlso I would like to mention, and I'm sure many people know this already, that this game also contains quite a few bugs such as not being able to hit a player whilst standing still and / or crouching aiming at their head.

Relative to modern shooters it is worse in about every aspect imaginable. 50% of the time no matter what your trust factor is you will get put in a game with a cheater, and you can't do anything but get an ass whooping for 40 minutes or abandon the match and get a competitive ban. What's worse is the fact that they have removed bots from competitive for LITERALLY no reason so an enemy team has no insentive to kick their cheater. That is, if they could even kick them. Not even an hour ago I was against a queue where 3 people were partied together blatantly walling and bhop scripting on mirage. My entire team played the game dead silent not even shooting at people most of the time. This game has been on a downwards slope for years and now genuinely makes me want to go back to source and/or 1.6. If you want to play this game competitively then you have to do it through a 3rd party org who will most likely pay for you to have a reasonable experience. At that point you may be thinking, this game should be alright now right? Wrong. High level faceit is mostly full of closet cheaters who play the game to win tournament money. This game is so fucking far into the abyss that I don't even see how Valve can fix it. They finally made it where you have to pay for prime now. That must be a step in the right direction right? Sure, but the hundreds of thousands of free accounts who got to level 21 using cheats got grandfathered in. I really hope Valve can salvage this game because they are doing so little over so long (and boy do I mean so so so long).\n\nanyways 9/10 this game is fun", "played it a bit, it's ok", "Well after many hours in the game,\nHave to say that the game is fun but gives you Mental illnesses.\nCan't stop to play i am an ADDICT.\nEvery Sunday i am going to a group therapy.\nThank you", "Well structured, competitive and fun game. However, CSGO environment has became toxic with the never ending waves of hackers. Don't bother to spend money in this game or consider buying premium since CSGO has no permanent solution towards the hackers so the game is very unfair and no fun when there's hackers.", "Game is overall a great game depending on many factors, which i will go over in this review. To start with this isn't a game you can just jump into and be #1, it takes a lot of practice, time and commitment. Overall i've played this game for 2,400+ hours combined between my multiple accounts. I have personally loved this game for what it has to offer and have always been a fan of the game-mode and the genre of the game.\n\nI will be going over the positives and negatives in this review as well as summing it up at the end with my overall thoughts and opinions. I will admit this game isn't for the light hearted, as the community is a fairly toxic but also pleasant community. I have made many friends but also dealt with a lot of childish players within this game. You will be able to make friends quite easily and play with them constantly making it easier to rank up as your playing with people you can communicate with rather then random people.\n\nThere are a few key points to this game that make it amazing those are, team work, communication, skill, knowledge and memory. Team work is a vital part of this game and is what makes it amazing, it's a lot harder to win when you aren't playing as a team, any great team requires great communication, communication is an important part, as well as knowing what to call and when to call it. This game requires some skill, at the higher levels a lot more skill. This doesn't necessarily mean you need to be the best, as there are ranks in competitive for a reason to assign you to people in similar ranks, although there are smurfs and cheaters as with any competitive game. Knowledge and memory go together, can't have one without the other in this game, you need to be knowledgeable in how to peek, where to peek, how to peek together and more similar situations, to top it off you also need good memory in where to smoke, how to smoke certain positions, as well as flashbangs and other utilities.\n\nIn saying that, that is mainly only the competitive side of this game, there are many other amazing features offered in this game, those being community servers, arms races, demolition, casual and other gamemodes. This game has a lot to offer, in particular one of my favourite parts of this game is the community servers, you have surf servers, and game servers, making it a game for everyone.\n\nIf you are feeling like taking your gaming to the next level i would highly recommend this game, there are many leagues to join i.e FaceIT and similar. There is also the pro scene which many make it to in different divisions, this allows for the best of the best to play for cash and other rewards.\n\nThis game has no real pay to win features besides when the game requires you to now pay for prime, which is totally worth it! There are skins, but those do not have any advantage besides player models which can make it harder to see the person which is playing.\n\nNow i will give you all a lovely bullet point list of what this has to offer quickly ran down with negatives and positives below:\n\nThe Negatives:\n1) The Community - This will be featured in both areas, as it is a downfall and a positive, the community can be quite toxic but also quite welcoming.\n2) Learning Curve - There is a learning curve for this game, so don't expect to jump in and be rambo.\n3) The Cheaters - This comes with any game, but in this game there is a chance you will run into cheaters quite frequently.\n\nThe Positives:\n1) Amazing Game - This game is always going to be a top game and very popular at that.\n2) Requires Co-operation - This game i personally enjoy for the fact it requires the team to work as a team.\n3) Fun Combat - The guns have recoil patterns to learn, getting a good one tap is quite fun. Overall combat is a great aspect of this game.\n4) Top Selling Game - This game is a top selling game for a reason, allowing all sorts of players from all over to play an amazing FPS.\n\nThats the good and bad quickly summed up, i will be updating this review as time goes on. I hope you all enjoyed and if you have any questions feel free to leave them below and I will get to you as soon as i can. If you are looking for a game to have some fun then this is the game for you, aslong as you know what your in for.

The game has a serious and ongoing hacker and smurfing problem, and even if someone isn't cheating, it's hard to play against anyone good without seriously questioning if they are using some kind of third party cheat. The game is fun to play about half of the time.\n\nI am definitely no where near top skill in this game, I only place GN, but it's hard to play competitively or even just for fun at all anymore when you always have to live in fear of someone cheating the system to ruin your day. While obviously not every match you place into is going to have a cheater or a smurf, after playing for long such matches appear enough to tarnish the whole experience.\n\nI still won't recommend you play Valorant though.", "I started playing CSGO a while back and basically play war games to get the yearly badge.  I'm not the greatest and I know there are players better than me, but when you have a player running up the stairs and they shoot you while their back is to you and kill you, something is going on.  Or you have another player who takes on 3 players of the enemy team and mows them down like nothing and continues playing.  Also, the AFKers who are continually dragged from one match to another (and no, they aren't turning in circles, they are just standing there) and their friends won't kick them, something needs to be done about this.\n\nBut the worse thing is the people with a high ping (over 150 or more) when the rest of the players are at 15-40 ping.  Why are these people even allowed to join these matches.  Also, with all the thousands of people in this game, why do I continually get placed with the same 7-10 players where I can't get kills because either my teammates or the other team are getting 16 - 22 headshots or more?  I left the game once and didn't play for six months, but I'm just after the badge, but finding it may not be worth it as Valve's anti-cheat isn't very effective.", "many cheaters", "The game is toxic and has to many cheaters.

I got the game for my son because he wanted to play it with his friends and I think playing this game with his friends made them closer. He gets out of the house a lot too with his friends and only spends some of his free time playing video games. I approve of this game because he seems to enjoy it and it has no negative effect on him or any of the kids that I know that play it too and it\u2019s all about strategy and competition and has

Please tell me how I can accomplish achievements: 1) Veteran of map Aztec, 2) Veteran of map Dust , 3) Veteran of map Shorttrain, 4) This Glass World, 5) Sniper, 6) Tourist when you removed these 3 maps, thereby making these achievements unworkable. I hope to hear an adequate answer from you, since I really do not understand what the problem is: you have deleted maps, delete achievements, do not want to delete achievements, add maps back. + The game is actively supported by developers, updates are coming out. I encounter such a problem for the first time and for my understanding it is nonsense when game developers remove game content so plus tied to achievements. I perform all games on 100% ONLY HONESTLY and how can I perform these achievements when they are broken?\n\nAnswer from Steam support:\n\nWe are currently aware that certain achievements are no longer able to be obtained due to the maps being removed from the game. Unfortunately, we cannot provide a workaround for obtaining these achievements but I have forwarded your concerns on this matter onto the CS:GO team so they're aware. \n\nPlease let us know if you have any other questions or issues that we may assist you with.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nThe developer has done nothing since 2017 when they have broken these 6 achievement. Maybe it is new fashion, break something that is working good. I want you to know only one thing if you ignore the quality of your project remember that this is the way to nowhere. I hope that there is at least 1 person in your development team who understands and will correct this problem.\n\nAbout the game:\n\nThe very good game. Didn't meet any bugs. The game engine gives us the very good picture.

AWP seems very OP...\n\nHello folks, just got the game today from the steam sale. Not completely new to CS, I've owned CSS for a few years now but only because it was on sale bundled with gmod which is what I was really after, though still a fun game that I'd play a few times a month.\n\nOnce thing I've noticed about almost every CSS server I've played on is every sniper but the Scout is banned, for good reason I thought since when I went into servers where they weren't banned no one was using anything but these weapons (mostly the AWP). In a game about making twitch precision headshots, the AWP seems to break it since you don't need to be very precise with it at all.\n\nMy experience with the AWP in CSS is actually why I've put off buying CS GO for so long. I knew that you get into most games through matchmaking meaning you have to deal with AWPS, and I feared most games would be reduced to everyone using AWPS vs everyone using AWPS, with people not using AWPS gettings shit on unless they're miles better than the enemy team. I ended up buying the game anyway today though since it's cheap and very popular.\n\nTurns out my fears were completely justified. The AWP completely breaks the game. All skill goes out the window once you can afford an AWP, just take a seat and anyone who approaches you instantly dies. Honestly I'm really disappointing and I'm already starting to regret this purchase, since I have a lot more fun in CSS where there are mostly no AWPS.\n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way about this weapon? I feel like the game would be so much better off without it. This one weapon is so game breaking that most CSS servers ban it, and this single weapon alone being legal has discouraged me from buying this entire game. I'm sure at the top 5% of play AWPS are balanced and natural part of the game... and CS elitists are going to have a field day with my \"noobish\" complaints, but honestly I don't give a shit :\\ because 95% of players aren't the top 5%.", "marf.", "Very good game, has good Mechanics, easy to get use to, affordable when u want, mm is easy and wm is even more easy , i rate this game a 9/10 u should buy it, it dosnt hurt to try another game other than fortnite :)\n\n- - -[Audience] - - -\n\u2610 Your Mom probably would enjoy this\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Everyone\n\u2611 Everyone except kids\n\u2611 Casual players\n\u2611 Pro players\n\u2611 People who plan to take one game and make it their life\n\n- - - [graphics] - - -\n\n\u2610 I want to poor bleach in my eyes\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\u2610 Bad, but playable.\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\n---[price]---\n\u2611 Free\n\u2610 Buy now\n\u2610 Worth the price\n\u2610 Wait for sale\n\u2610 Maybe if you have some spare money left\n\u2610 Do not buy it\n\u2610 Do not throw money into a trash can\n\n- - - [specs] - - -\n\n\u2611 Minimum\n\u2610 Medium\n\u2610 High end\n\u2610 NASA computer\n\n- - - [skill] - - -\n\n\u2611 Easy\n\u2610 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2611 Average (Depends on the difficulty set)\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Only the best of the best can complete this game\n\n---{Grind}---\n\u2611 Nothing\n\u2611 Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 A bit grindy...sometimes\n\u2610 Practically a full time job\n\n- - - [gameplay] - - -\n\n\u2611 Only gameplay, doesn't include a story.\n\u2610 There is a story, but most of the game is focused on gameplay.\n\u2610 Better than nothing I suppose...\n\u2610 Average.\n\u2610 Decent.\n\u2610 Amazing!\n\u2610 It\u2018ll replace your life\n\n- - - [bugs] - - -\n\n\u2610 Game itself is one big BUG\n\u2610 Lot of bugs (Can get annoying)\n\u2611 Few Bugs\n\u2610 You can use them for speedrun\n\u2610 Nothing (I've seen)\n\n---[time]---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of tea\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Not too short\n\u2611 Depends on you\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 Very Long\n\u2611 Endless\n\n- - - [length] - - -\n\u2610 One long, tedious grind\n\u2610 Better than mobile\n\u2610 Fun at first, but gets old quick\n\u2610 Consistently fun\n\u2611 Can't stop playing, even though I should be finished.", "good game", "apart fomr the constant russians telling me to f*** my mum its a great game", "i am black", "best game ngl so much better than valorant", "Give me knife or i will kill you all :)", "Great matchmaking", "good game", "It's Good.\n", "got better", "veyr tresh :(", "BEST OF THE BEST", "+ rep good game", "Nice Game", " so hhalalal mode so mcuh fun!", "Amazing game, as usual!", "Pls no", "liked it", "There are a lot of cheaters but still ok", "dancers", "nice game \ud83d\udc9c", "Very good BUM BUM nice skin BAM BAM yes", "Best game ever!!!", "nice game", "I got shot", "This game took all my money...", "Awesome if cheaters going off 4 just a hour", "FUN game try it out just try it out its a super fun game", "Love it, been playing for a looooong time", "pretty cool game", "cool game\n", "Game is very nice its my second time playing it <3", "this game good", "str8 banger bro", "every time i play comp, i get kicked while iam doing good, last game i played it was 15-7 til us and they kicked me, nice game", "bad game", "Good Game", "good game", "VERY COOL GAME LOTS OF CHEATERS AND HEAD ACHES :)))", "This is very good game, highly recommend this game", "Love & Hate relationship", "\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u043f", "maistuu salami", "NICE GAME \nMUST PLAY ONCE IN YOUR LIFETIME", "good game", "shit gamer", "they should make the knife droppable", "garbage", "very fun", "The best game", "this is doo doo game for little kid", "Good game but a lot of toxic russians :(.", "fun fun fun", "ITS OK", "sicko", "cs:go can ever be a fun game :3\n", "gud game", "nice game,but still best 1.6 <3\n", "good game", "dawdawdadad", "Really great game.

It does not feel like the exception; it feels like the rule. Indeed, some days I haven't even had a clean match based on how many of my prior matches have a convicted cheater in them.

However, a majority of that time spent has been in casual matches due to only being able to solo queue). As for the game itself it can be good fun just to dive straight into a server and get the satisfaction of tapping heads.\n\nHowever for both casual and competitive matches [i]it really is[/i] no place for anyone wanting to queue solo and, of course, it can be the same for other multiplayer games but not as bad as this game; that's for sure. As a prime example you most definitely and unfortunately will come across a player that will cheat as well as players that may not understand English which makes it a worse experience since communication is [b]key[/b] to truly work together as a team.\n\nIn addition to that, you may also either be matched up with players who are unfriendly and not showing good sportsmanship which only encourages negative mentality and stops you from fully focusing on the match.\n\nAlso I would like to mention, and I'm sure many people know this already, that this game also contains quite a few bugs such as not being able to hit a player whilst standing still and / or crouching aiming at their head.

Relative to modern shooters it is worse in about every aspect imaginable. 50% of the time no matter what your trust factor is you will get put in a game with a cheater, and you can't do anything but get an ass whooping for 40 minutes or abandon the match and get a competitive ban. What's worse is the fact that they have removed bots from competitive for LITERALLY no reason so an enemy team has no insentive to kick their cheater. That is, if they could even kick them. Not even an hour ago I was against a queue where 3 people were partied together blatantly walling and bhop scripting on mirage. My entire team played the game dead silent not even shooting at people most of the time. This game has been on a downwards slope for years and now genuinely makes me want to go back to source and/or 1.6. If you want to play this game competitively then you have to do it through a 3rd party org who will most likely pay for you to have a reasonable experience. At that point you may be thinking, this game should be alright now right? Wrong. High level faceit is mostly full of closet cheaters who play the game to win tournament money. This game is so fucking far into the abyss that I don't even see how Valve can fix it. They finally made it where you have to pay for prime now. That must be a step in the right direction right? Sure, but the hundreds of thousands of free accounts who got to level 21 using cheats got grandfathered in. I really hope Valve can salvage this game because they are doing so little over so long (and boy do I mean so so so long).\n\nanyways 9/10 this game is fun", "played it a bit, it's ok", "Well after many hours in the game,\nHave to say that the game is fun but gives you Mental illnesses.\nCan't stop to play i am an ADDICT.\nEvery Sunday i am going to a group therapy.\nThank you", "Well structured, competitive and fun game. However, CSGO environment has became toxic with the never ending waves of hackers. Don't bother to spend money in this game or consider buying premium since CSGO has no permanent solution towards the hackers so the game is very unfair and no fun when there's hackers.", "Game is overall a great game depending on many factors, which i will go over in this review. To start with this isn't a game you can just jump into and be #1, it takes a lot of practice, time and commitment. Overall i've played this game for 2,400+ hours combined between my multiple accounts. I have personally loved this game for what it has to offer and have always been a fan of the game-mode and the genre of the game.\n\nI will be going over the positives and negatives in this review as well as summing it up at the end with my overall thoughts and opinions. I will admit this game isn't for the light hearted, as the community is a fairly toxic but also pleasant community. I have made many friends but also dealt with a lot of childish players within this game. You will be able to make friends quite easily and play with them constantly making it easier to rank up as your playing with people you can communicate with rather then random people.\n\nThere are a few key points to this game that make it amazing those are, team work, communication, skill, knowledge and memory. Team work is a vital part of this game and is what makes it amazing, it's a lot harder to win when you aren't playing as a team, any great team requires great communication, communication is an important part, as well as knowing what to call and when to call it. This game requires some skill, at the higher levels a lot more skill. This doesn't necessarily mean you need to be the best, as there are ranks in competitive for a reason to assign you to people in similar ranks, although there are smurfs and cheaters as with any competitive game. Knowledge and memory go together, can't have one without the other in this game, you need to be knowledgeable in how to peek, where to peek, how to peek together and more similar situations, to top it off you also need good memory in where to smoke, how to smoke certain positions, as well as flashbangs and other utilities.\n\nIn saying that, that is mainly only the competitive side of this game, there are many other amazing features offered in this game, those being community servers, arms races, demolition, casual and other gamemodes. This game has a lot to offer, in particular one of my favourite parts of this game is the community servers, you have surf servers, and game servers, making it a game for everyone.\n\nIf you are feeling like taking your gaming to the next level i would highly recommend this game, there are many leagues to join i.e FaceIT and similar. There is also the pro scene which many make it to in different divisions, this allows for the best of the best to play for cash and other rewards.\n\nThis game has no real pay to win features besides when the game requires you to now pay for prime, which is totally worth it! There are skins, but those do not have any advantage besides player models which can make it harder to see the person which is playing.\n\nNow i will give you all a lovely bullet point list of what this has to offer quickly ran down with negatives and positives below:\n\nThe Negatives:\n1) The Community - This will be featured in both areas, as it is a downfall and a positive, the community can be quite toxic but also quite welcoming.\n2) Learning Curve - There is a learning curve for this game, so don't expect to jump in and be rambo.\n3) The Cheaters - This comes with any game, but in this game there is a chance you will run into cheaters quite frequently.\n\nThe Positives:\n1) Amazing Game - This game is always going to be a top game and very popular at that.\n2) Requires Co-operation - This game i personally enjoy for the fact it requires the team to work as a team.\n3) Fun Combat - The guns have recoil patterns to learn, getting a good one tap is quite fun. Overall combat is a great aspect of this game.\n4) Top Selling Game - This game is a top selling game for a reason, allowing all sorts of players from all over to play an amazing FPS.\n\nThats the good and bad quickly summed up, i will be updating this review as time goes on. I hope you all enjoyed and if you have any questions feel free to leave them below and I will get to you as soon as i can. If you are looking for a game to have some fun then this is the game for you, aslong as you know what your in for.

The game has a serious and ongoing hacker and smurfing problem, and even if someone isn't cheating, it's hard to play against anyone good without seriously questioning if they are using some kind of third party cheat. The game is fun to play about half of the time.\n\nI am definitely no where near top skill in this game, I only place GN, but it's hard to play competitively or even just for fun at all anymore when you always have to live in fear of someone cheating the system to ruin your day. While obviously not every match you place into is going to have a cheater or a smurf, after playing for long such matches appear enough to tarnish the whole experience.\n\nI still won't recommend you play Valorant though.", "I started playing CSGO a while back and basically play war games to get the yearly badge.  I'm not the greatest and I know there are players better than me, but when you have a player running up the stairs and they shoot you while their back is to you and kill you, something is going on.  Or you have another player who takes on 3 players of the enemy team and mows them down like nothing and continues playing.  Also, the AFKers who are continually dragged from one match to another (and no, they aren't turning in circles, they are just standing there) and their friends won't kick them, something needs to be done about this.\n\nBut the worse thing is the people with a high ping (over 150 or more) when the rest of the players are at 15-40 ping.  Why are these people even allowed to join these matches.  Also, with all the thousands of people in this game, why do I continually get placed with the same 7-10 players where I can't get kills because either my teammates or the other team are getting 16 - 22 headshots or more?  I left the game once and didn't play for six months, but I'm just after the badge, but finding it may not be worth it as Valve's anti-cheat isn't very effective.", "many cheaters", "The game is toxic and has to many cheaters.

I got the game for my son because he wanted to play it with his friends and I think playing this game with his friends made them closer. He gets out of the house a lot too with his friends and only spends some of his free time playing video games. I approve of this game because he seems to enjoy it and it has no negative effect on him or any of the kids that I know that play it too and it\u2019s all about strategy and competition and has

Please tell me how I can accomplish achievements: 1) Veteran of map Aztec, 2) Veteran of map Dust , 3) Veteran of map Shorttrain, 4) This Glass World, 5) Sniper, 6) Tourist when you removed these 3 maps, thereby making these achievements unworkable. I hope to hear an adequate answer from you, since I really do not understand what the problem is: you have deleted maps, delete achievements, do not want to delete achievements, add maps back. + The game is actively supported by developers, updates are coming out. I encounter such a problem for the first time and for my understanding it is nonsense when game developers remove game content so plus tied to achievements. I perform all games on 100% ONLY HONESTLY and how can I perform these achievements when they are broken?\n\nAnswer from Steam support:\n\nWe are currently aware that certain achievements are no longer able to be obtained due to the maps being removed from the game. Unfortunately, we cannot provide a workaround for obtaining these achievements but I have forwarded your concerns on this matter onto the CS:GO team so they're aware. \n\nPlease let us know if you have any other questions or issues that we may assist you with.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nThe developer has done nothing since 2017 when they have broken these 6 achievement. Maybe it is new fashion, break something that is working good. I want you to know only one thing if you ignore the quality of your project remember that this is the way to nowhere. I hope that there is at least 1 person in your development team who understands and will correct this problem.\n\nAbout the game:\n\nThe very good game. Didn't meet any bugs. The game engine gives us the very good picture.
